The CIS Controls are developed by a community of IT experts who apply their first-hand experience as cyber defenders to create these globally accepted security best practices. The experts who develop the CIS Controls come from a wide range of sectors including, retail, manufacturing, healthcare, education, government, defense, and others. So, while the CIS Controls address the general practices that most organizations should The Center for Internet Security, Inc. take to secure their systems, some operational (CIS) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization environments may present unique requirements whose mission is to identify, develop, not addressed by the CIS Controls. validate, promote, and sustain best practices in cybersecurity; deliver world-class We are at a fascinating point in the evolution of cybersecurity solutions to prevent and what we now call cyber defense.

To top it all off, we are surrounded by For additional information, go to security requirements, risk management https://www.cisecurity.org/ frameworks, compliance regimes, regulatory mandates, and so forth. There is no shortage of information available to security practitioners on what they should do to secure their infrastructure. But all of this technology, information, and oversight has become a veritable “Fog of More” – competing options, priorities, opinions, and claims that can paralyze or distract an enterprise from vital action. Business complexity is growing, dependencies are expanding, users are becoming more mobile, and the threats are evolving. New technology brings us great benefits, but it also means that our data and applications are distributed across multiple locations, many of which are not within our organization’s infrastructure. Rather than chase every new exceptional threat and neglect the fundamentals, how can we get on track with a roadmap of fundamentals and guidance for measures and improve? How can we get on track with a roadmap of fundamentals, and guidance to measure and improve cloud security? Which CIS Controls and defensive steps are applicable and have the greatest value? The CIS Controls started as a grassroots activity to cut through the "Fog of More" and focus on the most fundamental and valuable actions that every enterprise should take. This companion guide will break down and map the applicable Controls and their implementation for the cloud environment. As the CIS Controls continue to be refined and re-worked through the community, the call for this CIS Controls Guidance for the cloud was identified as one of the high priority companion documents to be developed. While many of the core security concerns of enterprise Information Technology (IT) systems are shared within cloud environments, the main challenge in applying best practices is tied to the fact that these systems typically operate software and hardware under different assumed security responsibilities. Ensuring and understanding that the service-level agreements (SLAs) and Legal Contracts with the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) highlight liability, service levels, breach disclosure, and incident response timeframes is an important piece of your cloud security. The shared security responsibility, as well as the specific cloud services and deployment models utilized, changes who handles the security requirements and whom the assumed security risk resides with. CSPs are constantly adding new functional services along with configuration and 3 security tools to better manage them at a very rapid pace. As new tools become available, the cloud consumer should consider a hybrid approach using third-party tools along with CSP native security tools that best fit an organization's security and management needs. Company management processes should ensure there is overlap rather than gaps in coverage between native and third-party tools. A cloud environment has four distinct service models that the application or service can fall under: • IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) is a cloud environment that computing resources such as virtual servers, storage, and networking hardware. The consumer utilizes their own software such as operating systems, middleware, and applications. The underlying cloud infrastructure is managed by the CSP. • PaaS (Platform as a Service) is a cloud computing environment for development and management of a consumer’s applications. It includes the infrastructure hardware: virtual servers, storage, and networking while tying in the middleware and development tools to allow the consumer to deploy their applications. It is designed to support the complete application lifecycle while leaving the management of the underlying infrastructure to the CSP. • SaaS (Software as a Service) is a cloud computing software solution that provides the consumer with access to a complete software product. The software application resides on a cloud environment and is accessed by the consumer through the web or an application program interface (API). The consumer can utilize the application to store and analyze data without having to worry about managing the infrastructure, service, or software, as that falls to the CSP. • FaaS (Function as a Service) is a cloud computing service that allows the consumer to develop, manage, and run their application functionalities without having to manage and maintain any of the infrastructure that is required. The consumer can execute code in response to events that happen within the CSP or the application without having to build out or maintain a complex underlying infrastructure. To complicate things even more, a cloud environment has multiple deployment models: • Private cloud (on-prem) consists of all the computing resources being hosted and used exclusively by one consumer (organization) within its own offices and data centers. The consumer is responsible for the operational costs, hardware, software, and the resources required to build and maintain the infrastructure. This is best used for critical business operations and applications that require complete control and configurability. • Private cloud (third-party hosted) is a private cloud that is hosted by an external third party provider. The third party provides an exclusive cloud environment for the consumer and manages the hardware. All costs associated with the maintenance is the responsibility of the consumer. • Community cloud (shared) is a deployment solution where the computing resources and infrastructure are shared between several organizations. The resources can be managed internally or by a third party and they can be hosted on-prem or externally. The organizations share the cost and often have similar cloud security requirements and business objectives. • Public cloud is an infrastructure and computing services hosted by a third party company defined as a CSP. It is available over the internet and the services are delivered through a self-service portal. The consumer is provided on-demand accessibility and scalability 4 without the high overhead cost of maintaining the physical hardware and software. The CSP is responsible for the management and maintenance of the system while the consumer pays only for resources they use. • Hybrid cloud is an environment that uses a combination of the three cloud deployment models, private cloud (on-prem), private cloud (third- party hosted), and public cloud with an orchestration service between the three deployment models. These are the kinds of issues that led to and now drive the CIS Controls Cloud Companion Guide, https://www.cisecurity.org/resources/white-papers/?o=controls. 5 How to Use This Document In this document, we provide guidance on how to apply the security best practices found in CIS Controls Version 7 to any cloud environment from the consumer/customer perspective. For each top-level CIS Control, there is a brief discussion of how to interpret and apply the CIS Control in such environments, along with any unique considerations or differences from common IT environments. The applicability of specific CIS Controls and CIS Sub-Controls is addressed, and additional steps needed in any cloud environment are explained, based on the individual service models. Throughout this document, we take into consideration the unique mission/business requirements found in cloud environments, as well as the unique risks (vulnerabilities, threats, consequences, and security responsibilities), which in turn drive the priority of the security requirements (e.g., availability, integrity, and confidentiality of process data). By walking through CIS Controls Version 7 with this companion guide, the reader should be able to tailor the CIS Controls in the context of a specific IT/OT cloud enterprise as an essential starting point for a security improvement assessment and roadmap. 6 Applicability Overview for each Service Model More than 60% of CIS Sub-Controls Apply Between 60% and 0% of the CIS Sub-Controls Apply 0% Applicability of Service Model Control Control Title 7 IaaS PaaS SaaS FaaS 1 Inventory and Control of Hardware Assets 2 Inventory and Control of Software Assets 3 Continuous Vulnerability Management 4 Controlled Use of Administrative Privileges Secure Configuration for Hardware and Software on Mobile Devices, 5 Laptops, Workstations and Servers 6 Maintenance, Monitoring and Analysis of Audit Logs 7 Email and Web Browser Protections 8 Malware Defenses 9 Limitation and Control of Network Ports, Protocols, and Services 10 Data Recovery Capabilities Secure Configuration for Network Devices, such as Firewalls, Routers 11 and Switches 12 Boundary Defense 13 Data Protection 14 Controlled Access Based on the Need to Know 15 Wireless Access Control 16 Account Monitoring and Control 17 Implement a Security Awareness and Training Program 18 Application Software Security 19 Incident Response and Management 20 Penetration Tests and Red Team Exercises CIS Control 1: Inventory and Control of Hardware Assets Actively manage (inventory, track, and correct) all hardware devices on the network so that only authorized devices are given access, and unauthorized and unmanaged devices are found and prevented from gaining access. Cloud Rationale The first CIS Control is considered the most important because it is necessary to first identify the systems and devices that need to be secured. CIS Control 1 is about taking inventory. Understanding and solving the asset inventory and device visibility problem is critical in managing a business security program. This is challenging in cloud environments due to the shared security responsibility and the cloud service model utilized.

Hardware Assets When considering deployment models, you will find that this CIS Control and Sub-Controls are applicable for Private (on-prem). For Private (third-party hosted), Public, and Hybrid deployment models, you will need to defer to the service/deployment model(s) your organization is using. Cloud Considerations • On-prem — The local administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for the security of everything (physical servers, room, network, storage, hypervisor, operating systems, etc.). • IaaS — The administrator (cloud consumer) deploys, operates, and maintains the virtual networks and virtual machines within this service model but does not manage the underlying cloud infrastructure (physical servers, physical network, storage, hypervisor, etc.) as that is the responsibility of the CSP. • PaaS — The administrator (cloud consumer) manages the development, testing, and deployment of their applications. They have full control over the applications and in some cases the host environment settings and operating systems. The CSP is responsible for the physical servers, physical network, storage, hypervisor, and operating systems. DHCP logging, port level access control might not be applicable. • SaaS — The administrator (cloud consumer) should consider utilizing client certificates to authenticate. • FaaS — The administrator (cloud consumer) should consider utilizing client certificates to authenticate. Cloud Additional Considerations • In a cloud environment, assets in on-prem, IaaS, or PaaS service models are virtual and can be in the form of virtual machines, virtual networks, virtual switches, etc. • Due to the nature of virtual systems and the ease to bring online a new virtual asset, it is imperative to maintain a comprehensive list of all the cloud hardware assets you manage. • It is always up to the consumer to request documentation outlining how the CSP is securing the infrastructure and technology that falls under their responsibility. • When collecting asset inventory, you should consider the criticality of the asset, the operating system and version, when the asset was discovered, and the asset tag if applicable. • In a Private cloud, it is very likely that the organization has full management control of the routing and switching, and CIS Sub-Control 1.7 may be implemented. In a Public cloud deployment model, implementing Sub-Control 1.7 is not feasible. 10 CIS Control 2: Inventory and Control of Software Assets Actively manage (inventory, track, and correct) all software on the network so that only authorized software is installed and can execute, and that all unauthorized and unmanaged software is found and prevented from installation or execution. Cloud Rationale The second CIS Control offers the guidance needed to identify, track, and account for all software utilized in an environment. This is challenging in cloud environments due to the shared security responsibility and the cloud service model utilized.

When considering deployment models, you will find that this CIS Control and Sub-Controls are applicable for Private (on-prem). For Private (third-party hosted), Public, and Hybrid deployment models, you will need to defer to the service/deployment model(s) your organization is using. Cloud Considerations • On-prem — The local administrator is responsible for keeping the inventory of all software utilized regardless of the service model. • IaaS — The administrator (cloud consumer) deploys, operates, and maintains the software utilized within this service model but does not manage the underlying cloud software like the hypervisor, operating systems, or applications that provide specific services as that is the responsibility of the CSP. • PaaS — The administrator (cloud consumer) manages the development, testing, and deployment of their software and applications. They have full control over the applications and in some cases the operating systems so they are responsible for all software running at this level. The CSP is responsible for the hypervisor and operating systems and other applications that provide this service. Application whitelisting, whitelisting of libraries, whitelisting of scripts, and segregating high-risk applications will not be applicable to all PaaS service models. • SaaS — The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for registering the software on the inventory list as approved. They are also responsible to make sure the vendor maintains support and vulnerability updates for the software and to keep record of it in the tracking software. Tracking software inventory could be manual. • -FaaS - The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for maintaining an inventory of authorized software. Tracking software inventory could be manual. Cloud Additional Considerations • In a cloud environment, running on-prem, IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, or FaaS, the software being used and maintained has to be inventoried, patched, and monitored when applicable. • It is imperative to maintain a comprehensive list of these cloud software assets to identify and mitigate any vulnerabilities and data associated with the software that you manage. • It is always up to the consumer to request documentation from the CSP outlining their responsibilities on how the CSP is securing the infrastructure and technology. • Also keep in mind that as part of the software inventory, the consumer should include the API endpoints. 13 CIS Control 3: Continuous Vulnerability Management Continuously acquire, assess, and take action on new information in order to identify vulnerabilities, remediate, and minimize the window of opportunity for attackers. Cloud Rationale This CIS Control addresses the need for continuous vulnerability management, which can be a significant task in most organizations. Understanding and managing vulnerabilities in a cloud environment can be more challenging than traditional IT systems. A cloud environment is dynamic, allowing you to scale your environment at an ever-changing pace. With the increasing use of DevOps and SecOps, the internal landscape is ever-changing. As enterprises migrate to the cloud, they are in a difficult position because of the risks and vulnerabilities associated with the use of cloud services. Giving control of some assets to a third party depending on the deployment model you are utilizing, and verifying the security and vulnerability status of those assets, is not always the responsibility of cloud consumers. Cloud environments also host cloud- specific vulnerabilities that have to be monitored and managed.

Cloud Considerations • On-prem – The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for continuous vulnerability management of the hardware and software, both physical and virtual servers, networking, middleware, and applications utilized. • IaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for continuous vulnerability management of the software, virtual servers, virtual networking, middleware, and applications utilized. The CSP is responsible for continuous vulnerability management with the infrastructure and technology that they provide. • PaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for continuous vulnerability management of the applications and development tools utilized. The CSP is responsible for continuous vulnerability management of the hardware infrastructure and software technology that they provide. • SaaS – This is not applicable for the cloud consumer. The CSP is responsible for everything but the data. • FaaS – This is not applicable for the cloud consumer. The CSP is responsible for everything but the code and the data utilized within the functions. Cloud Additional Considerations • It is always the cloud consumer's responsibility to request documentation from the CSP detailing how the CSP is securing the infrastructure and technology they are responsible for. • The consumer should continuously acquire, assess, and take action on new information in order to identify vulnerabilities, remediate, and minimize the window of opportunity for attackers. • When considering PaaS environments, some will have images or stem cells which, by default, do not allow for interactive users such as scanner accounts. The consumer should consider a solution that identifies vulnerabilities without introducing new vulnerabilities and which does not require a dedicated scanner account. • Some agents have download dependencies that may require opening up proxies or firewalls, which can introduce other risk elements that the consumer has to be aware of. 16 CIS Control 4: Controlled Use of Administrative Privileges The processes and tools used to track/control/prevent/correct the use, assignment, and configuration of administrative privileges on computers, networks, and applications. Cloud Rationale This CIS Control addresses the need for limiting and managing administrator access. The misuse of administrative privileges is a primary method for attackers to spread inside a target enterprise. One of the two primary ways for attackers to spread inside a system is by tricking a user with elevated credentials into opening an email attachment, downloading and running an infected file, or visiting a malicious website from an asset connected to the cloud environment. The second common technique used by attackers is elevation of privileges by guessing or cracking a password for an administrative user to gain access to a target machine. If administrative privileges are loosely and widely distributed, or identical passwords are used on less critical systems, the attacker has a much easier time gaining full control of systems, because there are many more accounts that can act as avenues for the attacker to compromise administrative privileges.

Account Login When considering deployment models, you will find that this CIS Control and Sub-Controls are applicable for Private (on-prem). For Private (third-party hosted), Public, and Hybrid deployment models, you will need to defer to the service/deployment model(s) your organization is using. Cloud Considerations • On-prem -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for all account administration and administrator access. • IaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for administrator account management for the software, virtual servers, virtual networking, middleware, and applications utilized. • PaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for all administrator account management for the applications and development tools utilized. • SaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for all administrator accounts for the software service utilized. When inventorying all administrative accounts, automated tools are recommended but not applicable for all SaaS service models unless administrative access is managed outside the service. • FaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for all administrator accounts that utilize and manage the code and setup of the functions. When inventorying all administrative accounts, automated tools are recommended but not applicable for FaaS service models unless administrative access is managed outside the service. Cloud Additional Considerations • Minimize the use of elevated privileges and only use administrative accounts where they are required. Track, control, prevent, and correct the use, assignment, and configuration of administrative privileges on computers, networks, and applications. • Account validation is performed by a system owner as opposed to a senior executive. • The use of multi-factor authentication should be applicable to all service models when it can be used with the software, application, service, or systems. • Default accounts that require administrative access and risks associated with altering those accounts should be reviewed and all changes verified with the vendor prior to making changes. 19 CIS Control 5: Secure Configuration for Hardware and Software on Mobile Devices, Laptops, Workstations, and Servers Establish, implement, and actively manage (track, report on, correct) the security configuration of mobile devices, laptops, servers, and workstations using a rigorous configuration management and change control process in order to prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerable services and settings. Cloud Rationale This CIS Control provides guidance for securing hardware and software. As delivered by the CSP, the default configurations for operating systems and applications are normally geared toward ease-of-deployment and ease-of-use ― not security. Basic controls, open services and ports, default accounts or passwords, older (vulnerable) protocols, pre-installation of unneeded software ― all can be exploitable in their default state. Even if a strong initial configuration is developed and deployed in the cloud, it must be continually managed to avoid configuration drift as software is updated or patched, new security vulnerabilities are reported, and configurations are “tweaked” to allow the installation of new software or to support new operational requirements. If not, attackers will find opportunities to exploit both network-accessible services and client software.

Cloud Considerations • On-prem -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for the use of a security baseline for all physical and virtual systems, software, and applications. • IaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for utilizing a security baseline for the software, virtual servers, virtual networking, middleware, and applications in the cloud environment. • PaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for utilizing a security baseline for the applications and development tools utilized. • SaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for a security baseline within the software and the data that is being utilized. • FaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for a security baseline within the code and the data being utilized. Cloud Additional Considerations • When configuration management tools are used, they should be set to alert-only without automated configuration re-deployment unless it is known to be safe to do so. • The CSP hosts typical image storage in cloud environments for PaaS, SaaS, and FaaS; therefore, the secure configuration of the underlying servers is the responsibility of the CSP. • As part of the established secure configurations, SaaS and FaaS should always communicate over transport layer security (TLS) and validate the TLS API endpoint cert. CIS Control 6: Maintenance, Monitoring, and Analysis of Audit Logs Collect, manage, and analyze audit logs of events that could help detect, understand, or recover from an attack. Cloud Rationale This CIS Control offers guidance for the maintenance and monitoring of audit logs. Without protected and complete logging records, an attack may go unnoticed indefinitely and the particular damages done may be irreversible. The CSP helps a consumer meet this Control by providing the ability to generate and monitor audit logs.

When considering deployment models, you will find that this CIS Control and Sub-Controls are applicable for Private (on-prem). For Private (third-party hosted), Public, and Hybrid deployment models, you will need to defer to the service/deployment model(s) your organization is using. Cloud Considerations • On-prem -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for the setup, maintenance, monitoring, and process analysis of the audit logs for all systems. • IaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for the setup, maintenance, monitoring, and process analysis of the audit logs for the software, virtual servers, virtual networking, middleware, and applications when applicable in the cloud environment. • PaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for the setup, maintenance, monitoring, and process analysis of the audit logs for the applications, operating systems, and development tools utilized when applicable in the cloud environment. • SaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for the setup, maintenance, monitoring, and process analysis of the audit logs once they are made available by the CSP. Time sources and the ability to enable logging are dependent on the CSP. • FaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for the setup, maintenance, monitoring, and process analysis of the audit logs once they are made available by the CSP. Time sources and the ability to enable logging are dependent on the CSP. Cloud Additional Considerations • For SaaS and FaaS solutions, it is often required that the CSP provides the required audit logs and allows for the consumer to access, review, and maintain logs based on the Controls as defined. • In some cases, the service solution might not support the level of logging recommended by this Control and its Sub-Controls. • It is the responsibility of cloud consumers to request the logs from the CSP. The consumer might want to consider creating a secure channel to download logs from the CSP. CIS Control 7: Email and Web Browser Protections Minimize the attack surface and the opportunities for attackers to manipulate human behavior through their interaction with web browsers and email systems. Cloud Rationale This CIS Control focuses on the security of web browsers and email clients, which are very vulnerable attack vectors. Quite often cloud environments require Internet web access. Depending on the cloud model, there might not be a requirement for email clients, and if email is utilized, it is typically only in an outgoing manner. It is common to have alerts and other message systems in place that monitor critical processes and send out reports via email. These emails are typically accessed from business or corporate assets that are on separate networks. Most web- based applications are now operating in the cloud.

Cloud Additional Considerations • Sub-Control 7.8, 7.9, and 7.10 are only applicable if you are running an email server in your cloud-hosted environment with on-prem, IaaS, or PaaS services. • The rest of the Sub-Controls related to using authorized browsers, scripting filters, and logging are applicable if you utilize any browser access off the servers or systems that you are running. • Since SaaS and possibly FaaS may be using a web browser to interact with the application, the web browser should be up-to-date. Additionally, any third-party extensions such as Flash or Java should be updated and the highest possible security policies should be applied according to your organizational requirements. • Ensure that no email clients are installed or present on any systems. Where a device or system has the capability to send email-based alerts or reports, ensure that it is limited to outbound only. 26 CIS Control 8: Malware Defenses Control the installation, spread, and execution of malicious code at multiple points in the enterprise, while optimizing the use of automation to enable rapid updating of defense, data gathering, and corrective action. Cloud Rationale This CIS Control addresses the steps needed to ensure a strong defense against malware intrusions. Malicious code is a very real threat to all environments and the cloud is no exception. While proper network segmentation and defense-in-depth strategies help to mitigate this risk by making it difficult for threat actors to deliver malware to their intended locations, malware defense still needs tools and processes in place to thwart and detect incidents. Unfortunately, the ability to collaborate, sync, and share―the same reasons consumers migrate to the cloud―are the reason that malware can spread quickly and can cause greater damage.

Cloud Considerations • On-prem -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for the setup, maintenance, monitoring, and analysis of the anti-malware software and other security settings for all physical and virtual devices in place to prevent any intrusions. • IaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for the setup, maintenance, monitoring, and analysis of the anti-malware software and other security settings for the software, virtual servers, virtual networking, middleware, and applications when applicable in the cloud environment. • PaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for the setup, maintenance, monitoring, and analysis of the anti-malware software and other security settings for the applications, operating systems, and development tools utilized when applicable. • SaaS -- This Control and all of it Sub-Controls is not applicable for the cloud consumer. • FaaS -- This Control and all of it Sub-Controls is not applicable for the cloud consumer. Cloud Additional Considerations • In a cloud environment, there are some instances where the virtual devices do not support the required endpoint software, thus making on-device malware monitoring difficult. • In the instances where malware defense is not the responsibility of the cloud consumer, it then becomes the responsibility of the CSP. CIS Control 9: Limitation and Control of Network Ports, Protocols, and Services Manage (track/control/correct) the ongoing operational use of ports, protocols, and services on networked devices in order to minimize windows of vulnerability available to attackers. Cloud Rationale This CIS Control focuses on the need for controlling network access points, ports, and services.

Cloud Considerations • On-prem -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for managing (track/control/correct) the ongoing operational use of ports, protocols, and services for all physical and virtual devices, and applications to minimize and prevent any intrusions. • IaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for managing (track/control/correct) the ongoing operational use of ports, protocols, and services for all software, virtual servers, virtual networking, middleware, and applications when applicable in the cloud environment. • PaaS – The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for managing (track/control/correct) the ongoing operational use of ports, protocols, and services for all applications, hosting operating systems environment settings, and developing the tools utilized. • SaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for managing (track/control/correct) the ongoing operational use of ports and some protocols, and services for the application/software that is running as a service in the cloud environment. In addition, SaaS might have specific port requirements to function so these have to be monitored for any changes. • FaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for managing (track/control/correct) the ongoing operational use of ports and some protocols as some of the functions or code affecting the specific actions or workflow will be dependent on those ports and protocols. Cloud Additional Considerations • When inventorying open or available network ports, the process or tools used should be non-intrusive and not affect the availability or reliability of the cloud systems or environment. 30 CIS Control 10: Data Recovery Capabilities The processes and tools used to properly back up critical information with a proven methodology for timely recovery of it. Cloud Rationale This CIS Control references the need for performing system backups for data recovery capability. Backing up system data to include user data in the cloud environment is important in all four service models. The ability to protect and recover system or user data in a timely manner is critical to cloud consumers. The challenge is often for the cloud consumer to remember that the protection and integrity of the user and system data can be their responsibility where the only thing the CSP is guaranteeing is the availability of the data.

Cloud Considerations • On-prem -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for all data recovery capabilities in the environment. • IaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for data recovery capabilities for all software, virtual servers, virtual networking, middleware, and applications when applicable in the cloud environment. • PaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for data recovery capabilities for all applications, hosting environment operating systems settings, and developing the tools utilized. • SaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for data recovery capabilities for the application/software that is running as a service in the cloud environment. Sub- Control 10.2 is not applicable to a SaaS service model as you are not able to back up a complete system while providing an image or a process such as imaging for recovery. • FaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for data recovery capabilities for the code and functions that are running as a service in the cloud environment. Sub- Control 10.2 is not applicable to a FaaS service model as you are not able to back up a complete system while providing an image or a process such as imaging for recovery. Cloud Additional Considerations • When referencing system data, be sure to include user data in that context. This inclusion is what makes this CIS Control and the majority of the CIS Sub-Controls applicable to a SaaS and FaaS service model. • The cloud consumer is always responsible for "their" data regardless of the service model. It is imperative that they have backup and/or redundancy in place so that there is no loss of data. 32 CIS Control 11: Secure Configuration for Network Devices, such as Firewalls, Routers, and Switches Establish, implement, and actively manage (track, report on, correct) the security configuration of network infrastructure devices using a rigorous configuration management and change control process in order to prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerable services and settings. Cloud Rationale This CIS Control addresses the need to manage the configuration of all network devices using a change control process. The network infrastructure of a cloud environment should require the same rigorous configuration management and change control process as a physical environment. Attack vectors, although virtual, remain the same with unsecure services, poor firewall, and network configurations, and default or legacy credentials.

Cloud Considerations • On-prem -- The local administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for the secure configuration of all network devices. • IaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) deploys, operates, and maintains the virtual networks and web application firewalls within this service model but does not manage the underlying cloud infrastructure like the physical servers, physical network, storage, hypervisor, etc., as that is the responsibility of the CSP. • PaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) manages the application, the host environment network settings, and the development tools network settings. The CSP is responsible for the physical servers, physical network, storage, hypervisor, and operating systems. • SaaS – This is not applicable for the cloud consumer. The CSP is responsible for all physical and virtual network device configuration. • FaaS – This is not applicable for the cloud consumer. The CSP is responsible for all physical and virtual network device configuration. Cloud Additional Considerations • Ensure all virtual firewalls are configured to deny by default. • Anytime multi-factor requirements can be applied will help maintain accountability and configuration management. 35 CIS Control 12: Boundary Defense Detect/prevent/correct the flow of information transferring networks of different trust levels with a focus on security-damaging data. Cloud Rationale This CIS Control focuses on the importance of managing the flow of information between networks of different trust levels. To control the flow of traffic through network borders and police content by looking for attacks and evidence of compromised machines, boundary defenses should be multi-layered, relying on firewalls, proxies, demilitarized zone (DMZ) perimeter networks, network-based intrusion prevention systems (IPS) and intrusion detection systems (IDS). It is also critical to filter both inbound and outbound traffic. This can be challenging in a cloud environment, as you do not always have the ability to set up the multi-layers to the same extent you can in a physical setup. Therefore, your boundary changes, along with where you set up that defense. Nonetheless, you still have to set up some defense.

When considering deployment models, you will find that this CIS Control and Sub-Controls are applicable for Private (on-prem). For Private (third-party hosted), Public, and Hybrid deployment models, you will need to defer to the service/deployment model(s) your organization is using. Cloud Considerations • On-prem -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for the network boundary defense. • IaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) deploys, operates, and maintains the virtual networks and virtual infrastructure so they are responsible for boundary defense from the cloud perspective. The CSP is responsible for the underlying cloud infrastructure boundary defense for the physical network. • PaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) might have some network port control options within the application or the host environment settings and operating systems and the development tools utilized to apply some deny communications, as outlined in Sub- Controls 12.3 and 12.4. • SaaS – This is not applicable to the cloud consumer. The CSP would be responsible for the boundary defense. • FaaS – This is not applicable to the cloud consumer. The CSP would be responsible for the boundary defense. Cloud Additional Considerations • Maintain and enforce a minimum-security standard for all devices remotely logging into the cloud network for on-prem and IaaS. • Maintain logging of all activities and traffic that pass through the cloud environment when looking at IaaS service models. • Recognize that not all traffic ingress or egress will necessarily pass through one virtual device or network. For this reason, it is crucial to identify all known and potential means for accessing your cloud environment and the virtual systems and networking. 38 CIS Control 13: Data Protection The processes and tools used to prevent data exfiltration, mitigate the effects of exfiltrated data, and ensure the privacy and integrity of sensitive information. Cloud Rationale This CIS Control’s focus is on data protection and ensuring the privacy and integrity of sensitive information. The cloud environment is not an exception to private data. If cloud consumers have realized anything while migrating information to the cloud, it is that protecting data can be more complicated. It is a growing concern for CSPs and consumers because any data leakage can go undetected for long periods of time.

When considering deployment models, you will find that this CIS Control and Sub-Controls are applicable for Private (on-prem). For Private (third-party hosted), Public, and Hybrid deployment models, you will need to defer to the service/deployment model(s) your organization is using. Cloud Considerations • Private (on-prem) -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for all of the data regardless of the service model used. • IaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for data protection but is limited to the virtual networks and virtual machines within this service model. The CSP is not responsible for any data loss due to lack of action or security defined for the consumer. • PaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) manages the data and access for the applications and in some cases the host environment settings and operating systems. • SaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for the data. The CSP is only responsible for making sure the data is online and that access is not granted outside of the application controlled by the cloud consumer. • FaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for the code and any data. The CSP is only responsible for making sure the data is online and that access is not granted outside of the functions called and controlled by the cloud consumer. Cloud Additional Considerations • Make sure that the data is not accessible to the public. Encrypt or use tokenization to protect sensitive data. Encryption has a number of limitations in SaaS solutions and does not allow the data to be searched; however, tokenization addresses that concern and limitation. • Control the systems and users that have access to the cloud platform and the data that might be exposed. When hosting any data in the cloud, consider the possible legal implications based on the data classification. More often than not, data protection, redundancy, and backup are the responsibility of the cloud consumer and not the CSP. 41 CIS Control 14: Controlled Access Based on the Need to Know The processes and tools used to track/control/prevent/correct secure access to critical assets (e.g., information, resources, systems) according to the formal determination of which persons, computers, and applications have a need and right to access these critical assets based on an approved classification. Cloud Rationale The focus of this CIS Control is around the process and tools used to determine which users, systems, and applications have the need and right to access critical data based on its classification. Consideration needs to be given to asset control lists (ACLs), virtual local area networks (VLANs), security groups, and other security in the CSP to control access and other routing requirements. There are many references to sensitive data throughout this Control. These references should align with CIS Control 13, Data Protection.

Cloud Considerations • Private (on-prem) -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for all access regardless of the service model used. • IaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for access to the virtual networks, virtual machines applications, the consumer account, and data protection within this service model. The CSP is not responsible for this access at the cloud consumer account level. • PaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) manages the access control for the applications and in some cases the host environment settings and operating systems. • SaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for the application and data access. The CSP is only responsible for making sure the data is online and that access is not granted outside of the application controlled by the consumer. • FaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for the functional code and data access. The CSP is only responsible for making sure the data is online and that access is not granted outside of the application controlled by the consumer. Cloud Additional Considerations • For organizations operating in the cloud, it is important to understand the security controls applied to data in the cloud multi-tenant environment, and determine the best course of action for application of encryption controls and security of keys. • When possible, keys should be stored within secure containers such as Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). 44 CIS Control 15: Wireless Access Control The processes and tools used to track/control/prevent/correct the secure use of wireless local area networks (WLANs), access points, and wireless client systems. Cloud Rationale This CIS Control references the security of wireless access points. Networks with wireless access points can be accessed from outside the physical building where security controls may be present. Likewise, rogue access points can be used to gain unrestricted access to internal systems and your environment. Due to the nature of cloud environments, wireless access controls fall under the physical controls outside of a cloud deployment and therefore they are not applicable.

When considering deployment models, you will find that this CIS Control and Sub-Controls are not applicable for Private (on-prem), Private (third-party hosted), Public, and Hybrid deployment models. You will need to defer to the service/deployment model(s) your organization is using. Cloud Considerations For organizations operating in the cloud, Wireless Access Control (WAC) is not specific to that type of environment, and it will have most of its dependencies on the CIS Control and Sub- Control with reference to the physical operation of the organization. CIS Control 16: Account Monitoring and Control Actively manage the life cycle of system and application accounts - their creation, use, dormancy, deletion - in order to minimize opportunities for attackers to leverage them. Cloud Rationale This CIS Control focuses on managing the life cycle of system and application accounts. As part of this management, rules and processes should be established for the creation, use, dormancy, and deletion of all cloud accounts, in order to minimize opportunities for attackers to leverage them. When an employee leaves the organization or changes roles, a common vulnerability can arise if employee accounts are not closed or modified.

When considering deployment models, you will find that this CIS Control and Sub-Controls are applicable for Private (on-prem). For Private (third-party hosted), Public, and Hybrid deployment models, you will need to defer to the service/deployment model(s) your organization is using. Cloud Considerations • Private (on prem) -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for all accounts regardless of the service model used. • IaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for all accounts utilized on the virtual networks, virtual machines, applications, etc. The CSP is not responsible for this access at the cloud consumer account level. • PaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) manages the accounts for the applications and in some cases the host operating systems. • SaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for the application accounts. • FaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for the accounts that have the ability to build the code execution based on the cloud functions. Cloud Additional Considerations • For consumers operating in the cloud, it is even more important to understand and maintain account control and inventory. The consumer is responsible for all the accounts and what level of access those accounts have to their cloud environment. • When possible, multi-factor authentication should be required. • The use of shared service accounts should be limited. • Permissions should be granted through group membership, as that is easier to manage. • The account principle of least privilege access should be followed. 49 CIS Control 17: Implement a Security Awareness and Training Program For all functional roles in the organization (prioritizing those mission-critical to the business and its security), identify the specific knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to support defense of the enterprise; develop and execute an integrated plan to assess, identify gaps, and remediate through policy, organizational planning, training, and awareness programs. Cloud Rationale This CIS Control focuses on educating and training the enterprise workforce in a range of security practices that span from “basic to advanced skills” to “security awareness and vigilance.” Human error, oversights, and negligence are leading causes of security weakness, and the consequences of untrained or infrequently trained personnel in a cloud environment can have a range of damaging effects. Regardless of the service model or deployment, security awareness and training are the responsibility of the organization operating in the cloud.

For Private (third-party hosted), Public, and Hybrid deployment models, you will need to defer to the service/deployment model(s) your organization is using. Cloud Considerations The security awareness and training program is solely the cloud consumer’s responsibility. Although the CSP should implement their own security training program, this CIS Control and its applicability to the cloud environment is a requirement for the cloud consumer. CIS Control 18: Application Software Security Manage the security life cycle of all in-house developed and acquired software in order to prevent, detect, and correct security weaknesses. Cloud Rationale This CIS Control focuses on the security of applications (in-house developed or acquired off the shelf or from external developers). This is a complex activity requiring a complete program encompassing enterprise-wide policy, technology, and the role of people. Any cloud environment service model or deployment model should be a part of this program. All software should be regularly tested for vulnerabilities when applicable. The operational practice of scanning for application vulnerabilities is consolidated within CIS Control 3: Continuous Vulnerability Management. However, the most effective approach is to implement a full supply chain security program for externally acquired software and a Secure Software Development Life Cycle for internally developed software.

For Private (third-party hosted), Public, and Hybrid deployment models, you will need to defer to the service/deployment model(s) your organization is using. Cloud Considerations • Private (on-prem) -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for all application software security regardless of the service model used. • IaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for all application software security. The CSP will provide permission and access for scanning the cloud consumer software. • PaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) manages the application software security for the applications and in some cases the host environment settings and operating systems. The CSP will provide permission and access for scanning the cloud consumer software. • SaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for the application software security. The CSP is only responsible for making sure the data is online and for providing access for scanning for vulnerabilities by the cloud consumer. • FaaS -- The administrator (cloud consumer) is responsible for the functional code and application software security. Cloud Additional Considerations • Depending on the deployment model, scanning applications for vulnerabilities will sometimes require the cloud consumer to request permission from the CSP. As part of this request, the consumer will often have to provide detailed information to include any IP addresses, timeframe, etc. • If the consumer is utilizing a SaaS service model, the conversation will focus on the CSP's ability to provide the application vulnerability management along with the vulnerability assessment reports for the product if applicable. • In the SaaS and IaaS service models, there is often the opportunity for vendor-provided API integration. Any vendor-provided APIs or custom-built APIs should be scanned and reviewed. CIS Control 19: Incident Response and Management Protect the organization's information, as well as its reputation, by developing and implementing an incident response infrastructure (e.g., plans, defined roles, training, communications, management oversight) for quickly discovering an attack and then effectively containing the damage, eradicating the attacker's presence, and restoring the integrity of the network and systems. Cloud Rationale This CIS Control focuses on how to manage and respond to a successful cyber-attack against an enterprise. The question of a successful cyber-attack against an enterprise is not “if” but “when.” Cyber incidents are now just part of our way of life. Even large, well-funded, and technically sophisticated enterprises struggle to keep up with the frequency and complexity of attacks. When an incident occurs, it is too late to develop the right procedures, reporting, data collection, management responsibility, legal protocols, and communications strategy that will allow the enterprise to successfully manage and recover. Without an incident response plan, an organization may not discover an attack in the first place, or, if the attack is detected, the organization may not follow good procedures to contain damage, eradicate the attacker’s presence, and recover in a secure fashion.

When considering deployment models, you will find that this CIS Control and Sub-Controls are applicable for Private (on-prem). For Private (third-party hosted), Public, and Hybrid deployment models, you will need to defer to the service/deployment model(s) your organization is using. Cloud Considerations Incident response and management is no different in the cloud. If you have process and procedures in place organizationally, they can be utilized for any of the cloud service and deployment models. The major consideration is where the security management lies and the conversations that you will have with the CSP around the incident. 57 CIS Control 20: Penetration Tests and Red Team Exercises Test the overall strength of an organization's defense (the technology, the processes, and the people) by simulating the objectives and actions of an attacker. Cloud Rationale This CIS Control is focused on designing and conducting controlled penetration testing in an operational technology environment, including connected devices and systems regardless of their location and nature (physical, virtual, cloud). Attackers often exploit the gap between good defensive designs and intentions and implementation or maintenance. Examples include: the time window between announcement of a vulnerability, the availability of a vendor patch, and actual installation on every machine. Other examples include: failure to apply good configurations to machines that come on and off of the network; and failure to understand the interaction among multiple defensive tools, or with normal system operations that have security implications. Penetration tests can provide significant value, but only when basic defensive measures are already in place, and when these tests are performed as part of a comprehensive, ongoing program of security management, and improvement as outlined in the Controls. Each organization should define a clear scope and rules of engagement for penetration testing and Red Team analyses. The scope of such projects should include, at a minimum, systems with the organization’s highest value information and production processing functionality.

When considering deployment models, you will find that this CIS Control and Sub-Controls are applicable for Private (on-prem). For Private (third-party hosted), Public, and Hybrid deployment models, you will need to defer to the service/deployment model(s) your organization is using. Cloud Considerations • Running pen tests and Red Team exercises will require the cloud consumer to request permission from the CSP. As part of this request, the consumer will often have to provide detailed information to include any IPs to be scanned, source IPs, timeframe, etc. A penetration tester might have to obtain credentials to any third-party tools that complement the cloud provider tools available in the security center to obtain a complete picture of the client's security operations. The penetration tester, when doing a cloud review, will also need at the minimum the Reader + SecurityReader roles to include access to the cloud provider’s security center. • While you may need permission to test from the FaaS service provider, regular testing against the application interface should be a part of this process. Penetration testing against FaaS may require commentary to permit exceptions where this is not practical, or is explicitly prohibited by the FaaS service provider. In the case that pen testing is not practical or is prohibited, source code review should be done in addition to performing security related unit testing. 60 Links and Resources • CIS Controls - https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/ • https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/itl/cloud/NIST_SP-500-291_Version- 2_2013_June18_FINAL.pdf • https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/itl/cloud/CloudFrameworkSP500_316- 2.pdf • https://iasecontent.disa.mil/cloud/SRG/index.html • https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/ • https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/ • https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-paas/ • https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-a-private-cloud/ • https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-a-public-cloud/ • https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-are-private-public-hybrid-clouds/ • https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-a-private-cloud/ • https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/serverless-computing/ • https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/what-is-public-cloud • https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/what-is-private-cloud • https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/what-is-private-cloud • http://www.cloudgarage.in/cloud-services/hybrid/ • https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/public_cloud.html • https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/difference-private-cloud-premise/ • https://www.techopedia.com/definition/26559/community-cloud • https://www.eci.com/cloudforum/private-cloud-explained.html • https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/iaas-paas-saas • https://medium.com/@BoweiHan/an-introduction-to-serverless-and-faas-functions-as-a- service-fb5cec0417b2 In this document, we provide guidance on how to apply the security best practices found in CIS Controls Version 7 to cloud environments.
