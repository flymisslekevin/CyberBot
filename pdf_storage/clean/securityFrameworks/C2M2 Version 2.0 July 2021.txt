Updated self-evaluation The self-evaluation tool was updated to a new PDF format with additional tool reports to make the tool more robust and more useful. In addition, an HTML- based tool was developed. Both tools maintain all data on users’ local machines. viii Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, Version 2.0 INTRODUCTION 1. INTRODUCTION Repeated cyber intrusions into organizations of all types demonstrate the need for improved cybersecurity. Cyber threats continue to grow, and they represent one of the most serious operational risks facing modern organizations. National security and economic vitality depend on the reliable functioning of critical infrastructure and the sustained operation of organizations of all types in the face of such threats. The Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model can help organizations of all sectors, types, and sizes to evaluate and make improvements to their cybersecurity programs and strengthen their operational resilience. The C2M2 focuses on the implementation and management of cybersecurity practices associated with information, information technology (IT), and operations technology (OT) assets and the environments in which they operate. The model can be used to:  strengthen organizations’ cybersecurity capabilities  enable organizations to effectively and consistently evaluate and benchmark cybersecurity capabilities  share knowledge, best practices, and relevant references across organizations as a means to improve cybersecurity capabilities  enable organizations to prioritize actions and investments to improve cybersecurity capabilities The C2M2 is designed for use with a self-evaluation methodology and tool (available by request) for an organization to measure and improve its cybersecurity program.1 A self-evaluation using the tool can be completed in one day, but the tool could be adapted for a more rigorous evaluation effort. Additionally, the C2M2 can be used to guide the development of a new cybersecurity program. The C2M2 provides descriptive rather than prescriptive guidance. The model content is presented at a high level of abstraction so that it can be interpreted by organizations of various types, structures, sizes, and industries. Broad use of the model by a sector can support benchmarking of the sector’s cybersecurity capabilities. These attributes also make the C2M2 an easily scalable tool for implementing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework [NIST CSF]. 1.1 Intended Audience The C2M2 enables organizations to evaluate cybersecurity capabilities consistently, communicate capability levels in meaningful terms, and prioritize cybersecurity investments. The model can be used by any organization, regardless of ownership, structure, size, or 1 The C2M2 self-evaluation tools may be obtained by sending a request to C2M2@hq.doe.gov or by visiting https://www.energy.gov/C2M2. 1 Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, Version 2.0 INTRODUCTION industry.

BACKGROUND C2M2 was first released in 2012 and was updated in 2014 in support of the Electricity Subsector Cybersecurity Risk Management Maturity Initiative, a White House initiative led by the DOE in partnership with the DHS and in collaboration with private- and public-sector experts and representatives of asset owners and operators within the electricity subsector. The initiative used the National Infrastructure Protection Plan framework as a public-private partnership mechanism to support the development of the model. The C2M2, Version 2.0 initiative leveraged and built upon existing efforts, models, and cybersecurity best practices to advance the model by adjusting to new technologies, practices, and environmental factors. Since the previous releases, more strategic guidance has been provided by the White House through Presidential Executive Orders 13800 “Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure”5 and 13636 “Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.”6 C2M2, Version 2.0 aligns to recent strategic guidance to strengthen and improve the nation’s cybersecurity posture and capabilities and to reinforce the need for action towards systematic security and resilience. C2M2, Version 2.0 incorporates other enhancements to better align model domains and practices with internationally recognized cybersecurity standards and best practices, including the NIST Cybersecurity Framework Version 1.1 released in April 2018. Since C2M2 was last updated, new cybersecurity standards and frameworks have been developed, existing standards have improved, and technology has evolved. The energy sector has increasingly become a target of malicious actors as industry increases the use of networked technologies. These challenges and the evolution of cybersecurity practices necessitated the update. 2.1 Model Development Approach C2M2, Version 2.0 builds upon initial development activities and is enhanced through the following approach:  Public–private partnership: Numerous government, industry, and academic organizations participated in the development of the model, bringing a broad range of knowledge, skills, and experience to the team. The initial model was developed collaboratively with an industry advisory group through a series of working sessions, and the new version was revised based on feedback from more than 60 industry experts with extensive experience using Version 1.1. 5 https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/articles/strengthening-the-cybersecurity-of-federal-networks-and-critical-infrastructure/ 6 h t t p s : / / o b a m a w h it e h o u s e . a r c h iv e s . g o v / t h e-press-office/2013/02/12/executive-order-improving-critical-infrastructure-cybersecurity 3 Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, Version 2.0 BACKGROUND  Best practices and sector alignment: The model builds upon and ties together a number of existing cybersecurity resources and initiatives and was informed by a review of cyber threats to the subsector. Leveraging related works shortened the development schedule and helped to ensure that the model would be relevant and beneficial to the subsector.  Descriptive, not prescriptive: The model was developed to provide descriptive, not prescriptive, guidance to help organizations develop and improve their cybersecurity capabilities. As a result, the model practices tend to be abstract so that they can be interpreted for organizations of various structures, functions, and sizes. 4 Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, Version 2.0 CORE CONCEPTS 3. CORE CONCEPTS This chapter describes several core concepts that are important for interpreting the content and structure of the model. 3.1 Maturity Models A maturity model is a set of characteristics, attributes, indicators, or patterns that represent capability and progression in a particular discipline. Model content typically exemplifies best practices and may incorporate standards or other codes of practice of the discipline. A maturity model thus provides a benchmark against which an organization can evaluate the current level of capability of its practices, processes, and methods and set goals and priorities for improvement. Also, when a model is widely used in a particular industry and assessment results are anonymized and shared, organizations can benchmark their performance against other organizations. An industry can determine how well it is performing overall by examining the capability of its member organizations. To measure progression, maturity models typically have “scaled levels.” C2M2 uses a scale of maturity indicator levels (MILs) 0–3, which are described in Section 4.2. A set of attributes defines each level. If an organization demonstrates these attributes, it has achieved both that level and the capabilities that the level represents. Having measurable transition states between the levels enables an organization to use the scale to:  define its current state  determine its future, more mature state  identify the capabilities it must attain to reach that future state 3.2 Critical Infrastructure Objectives The model makes regular reference to critical infrastructure objectives. These are objectives found in the sector-specific infrastructure protection plans7 of the 16 United States critical infrastructure sectors defined in Presidential Policy Directive 21, “Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience.”8 The referenced objectives serve as a reminder that many of the functions provided by potential adopters of the model support the Nation’s critical infrastructure and that the broader cybersecurity objectives of the sector-specific plans should be considered. Critical infrastructure objectives often transcend the business or operational objectives for an individual organization. Some organizations using the model may not be affiliated with any of the defined critical infrastructure sectors. For such organizations, the term critical infrastructure 7 http://www.dhs.gov/sector-specific-plans 8 h t t p : / / w w w . w h it e h o u s e . g o v / t h e - p r e s s - o f fice/2013/02/12/presidential-policy-directive-critical-infrastructure-security-and-resil 5 Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, Version 2.0 CORE CONCEPTS objectives can be interpreted to mean industry objectives, community objectives, or any other objectives that transcend the specific business or operational objectives for the organization but which the organization has a role and interest in fulfilling. 3.3 Enterprise, Organization, and Function The terms enterprise, organization, and function identify which part of an entity the text of the model is referring to. Function refers to the part of an entity to which the C2M2 will be applied (as described further in Section 3.3.1). Organization is a higher level administrative unit in which the function resides (e.g., an operating company). Enterprise refers to the highest level administrative unit within an entity using the C2M2 (e.g., a parent company). It is also important to consider that the C2M2 model was designed to apply to a wide variety of entity types. Some enterprises may consist of multiple organizations (e.g., a holding company with one or more operating companies); other organizations may have a more homogenous structure that does not necessitate any differentiation between the terms enterprise and organization. For those organizations, enterprise and organization may be used interchangeably. Figure 1 depicts how the enterprise, organization, and function may be organized in a notional entity. Figure 1: Example of the Structure of a Notional Entity 3.3.1 Function In the model, the term function is used as a scoping mechanism; it refers to the operations of the organization that are being evaluated based on the model. It is common for an organization to use the model to evaluate a subset of its operations. As stated earlier, the C2M2 focuses on the implementation and management of cybersecurity practices associated with information, information technology, and operations technology assets and the environments in which they operate. Selecting the function that will be the focus of a C2M2 evaluation determines both the specific assets and people to be evaluated. Together, they constitute the function’s operating environment. 6 Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, Version 2.0 CORE CONCEPTS The model broadly defines the function to allow organizations the greatest degree of flexibility in determining the scope of the evaluation that is appropriate for them. Functions can align with organizational boundaries or they can align to a single product line or system that may cross organizational boundaries. They might include departments; lines of business; distinct facilities; network security zones; groupings of assets; or assets, processes and resources managed externally, such as assets that reside in the cloud. Examples of functions include Enterprise IT, Power Distribution, Power Generation, Plant Control and Monitoring System, E-Services, Bulk Electric SCADA System, ICS for Refinement Operations, Fuel Transportation, and Storage Terminals. To help clarify evaluation responses, organizations will sometimes limit the scope even further, based on whether the assets are regulated or unregulated or based on their location, such as by region or on-site versus off-site. Some things to consider when defining the function are:  its significance to the organization’s mission  its stakeholders  its supporting assets  whether the organization has identifiable ownership (that is, authority) over its supporting assets Organizations should select only functions that they can clearly determine based on the criteria above. For example, an organization evaluates Plant Control and Monitoring systems. The organization describes the function’s criteria as follows:  its significance to the organization’s mission The function directly supports our largest plant in the state. -  its stakeholders Internally our finance department gets a report of our output per week. - Internally our parent organization requires access to collect information. - Externally the plant provides power for X number of people, Y cities, Z - counties.  its supporting assets IT equipment that directly supports the function. - OT equipment that directly supports the function. - Information assets that directly support the function. - Finance and HQ receive reports directly from the system. - There are 3 stations that are staffed 24/7 with 4 people per shift for 4 shifts. - We have 2 vendors that can provide administrative support to the IT or OT - systems via VPN. The maintenance and engineering team has endpoint connection access to - the equipment but not the control room. The ICS system is redundant and can be swapped in by the control room. - 7 Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, Version 2.0 CORE CONCEPTS - There is a backup site about 100 miles away, which is connected through VPN and backs up the software and data on the network daily. ICS data files are backed up during maintenance periods every 6 months.  whether the organization has identifiable ownership (that is, authority) over its supporting assets Ownership is shared between the IT department (IT equipment and network) - and the Plant (ICS and other OT equipment). When determining the function, one should try to avoid encompassing multiple organizations that have substantially different cybersecurity activities. For example, if an organization has a subsidiary whose cybersecurity activities are substantially different from those of headquarters, it is recommended that the organization perform separate evaluations for the subsidiary and headquarters. Combining these units in one evaluation may result in less accurate or actionable evaluation results for headquarters and the subsidiary. 3.4 Assets Many C2M2 practices refer to assets. For the purposes of the model, assets are IT assets, OT assets, and information assets. Some practices specify particular asset types. IT and OT assets include both hardware and software, such as traditional and emerging enterprise IT assets and any industrial control system (ICS) devices, process control system devices and components, safety instrumented systems, Internet of things (IoT) devices, industrial Internet of things (IIoT) devices, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system devices and components, network and communications assets, and assets residing in the cloud. Information assets are produced and used by IT, OT, and people to support the delivery of the function. Examples of information assets include customer data, financial records, firewall configuration files, security information and event management (SIEM) log files, historian data, SCADA set points, and configuration files. When evaluating whether a practice is performed completely, all forms of assets that the function relies on should be considered. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, organizations should account for all types of assets that may be in scope for the self-evaluation, such as virtualized assets, regulated assets, cloud assets, and mobile assets. Additionally, each type of asset may have several unique variations. For example, cloud assets may include software as a service, platform as a service, infrastructure as a service, etc., and may be public, private, or hybrid. Additionally, C2M2 refers to two other groupings of assets: assets that are important to the delivery of the function and assets within the function that may be leveraged to achieve a threat objective. Assets that are important to the delivery of the function includes assets that are required for a normal state of operation of the function and output of the function’s products or services. Loss of an asset that is considered important to the delivery of the function may not directly result in an inability to deliver the function but could result in operations being degraded. Identification 8 Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, Version 2.0 CORE CONCEPTS of an important asset should focus on loss of the service or role performed by that asset and should not include consideration of asset redundancy or other protections applied to assets. Assets within the function that may be leveraged to achieve a threat objective includes assets that may be used in the pursuit of the tactics or goals of a threat actor. Identification of assets within the function that may be leveraged to achieve a threat objective should focus on the techniques used by threat actors and assets that may be targeted or leveraged by threat actors. These are some examples of assets within the function that may be leveraged to accomplish a threat objective:  public-facing assets that may serve as an initial access point  individual systems that would allow lateral movement within an organization’s network  systems with administrative rights that would enable privilege escalation  information such as personally identifiable information that may cause harm to the organization or its stakeholders if lost, stolen, or disclosed Note that an organization’s list of assets that are important to the delivery of the function might include assets within the function that may be leveraged to achieve a threat objective and vice versa. Identifying assets within the function that may be leveraged to achieve a threat objective enables the organization to view assets from the perspective of a threat actor. It is not the intention of the model that all assets be categorized as assets that might be leveraged to achieve a threat objective, but only those that a risk-based approach identifies as being worthy of attention and further analysis. Because the assets noted above are the focus of a number of practices in C2M2, identifying which assets will be in scope for use of the C2M2 in advance of an evaluation will improve the pace and the accuracy of the evaluation. 9 Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, Version 2.0 MODEL ARCHITECTURE 4. MODEL ARCHITECTURE The model is organized into 10 domains. Each domain is a logical grouping of cybersecurity practices. The practices within a domain are grouped by objective—target achievements that support the domain. Within each objective, the practices are ordered by maturity indicator levels (MILs). The following sections include additional information about the domains and the MILs. 4.1 Domains, Objectives, and Practices The C2M2 includes 342 cybersecurity practices, which are grouped into 10 domains. These practices represent the activities an organization can perform to establish and mature capability in the domain. For example, the Asset, Change, and Configuration Management domain is a group of practices that an organization can perform to establish and mature asset management, change management, and configuration management capabilities. The practices within each domain are organized into objectives, which represent achievements that support the domain. For example, the Asset, Change, and Configuration Management domain comprises five objectives: 1. Manage IT and OT Asset Inventory 2. Manage Information Asset Inventory 3. Manage Asset Configuration 4. Manage Changes to Assets 5. Management Activities 10 Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, Version 2.0 MODEL ARCHITECTURE Each of the objectives in a domain comprises a set of practices, which are ordered by MIL. Figure 2 summarizes the elements of each domain. Figure 2: Model and Domain Elements For each domain, the model provides a purpose statement, which is a high-level summary of the intent of the domain, followed by introductory notes, which give context for the domain and introduce its practices. The purpose statement and introductory notes offer context for interpreting the practices in the domain. The purpose statement for each of the 10 domains follows in the order in which the domains appear in the model. Next to each of the domain names, a short name is provided that is used throughout the model.

Cybersecurity Program Management (PROGRAM) Establish and maintain an enterprise cybersecurity program that provides governance, strategic planning, and sponsorship for the organization’s cybersecurity activities in a manner that aligns cybersecurity objectives with both the organization’s strategic objectives and the risk to critical infrastructure. 12 Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, Version 2.0 MODEL ARCHITECTURE 4.2 Maturity Indicator Levels The model defines four maturity indicator levels (MILs), MIL0 through MIL3, which apply independently to each domain in the model. The MILs define a dual progression of maturity: an approach progression and a management progression, which are explained in the following sections. Four aspects of the MILs are important for understanding and applying the model.  The maturity indicator levels apply independently to each domain. As a result, an organization using the model may be operating at different MIL ratings in different domains. For example, an organization could be operating at MIL1 in one domain, MIL2 in another domain, and MIL3 in a third domain.  The MILs are cumulative within each domain. To earn a MIL in a given domain, an organization must perform all of the practices in that level and its predecessor level(s). For example, an organization must perform all of the domain practices in MIL1 and MIL2 to achieve MIL2 in the domain. Similarly, the organization must perform all practices in MIL1, MIL2, and MIL3 to achieve MIL3.  Establishing a target MIL for each domain is an effective strategy for using the model to guide cybersecurity program improvement. Organizations should become familiar with the practices in the model prior to determining target MILs. Then, they can focus gap analysis activities and improvement efforts on achieving those target levels.  Practice performance and MIL achievement need to align with business objectives and the organization’s cybersecurity program strategy. Striving to achieve the highest MIL in all domains may not be optimal. Companies should evaluate the costs of achieving a specific MIL versus its potential benefits. However, the model was designed so that all companies, regardless of size, should be able to achieve MIL1 across all domains. 4.2.1 Summary of MIL Characteristics Table 4 summarizes the characteristics of each MIL. At MIL2 and MIL3, the characteristic associated with the approach progression is distinguished from the characteristics associated with the management progression. 13 Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, Version 2.0 MODEL ARCHITECTURE Table 3: Summary of Maturity Indicator Level Characteristics Level Characteristics MIL0 • Practices are not performed MIL1 • Initial practices are performed but may be ad hoc MIL2 Management characteristics: • Practices are documented • Adequate resources are provided to support the process Approach characteristic: • Practices are more complete or advanced than at MIL1 MIL3 Management characteristics: • Activities are guided by policies (or other organizational directives) • Personnel performing the practices have adequate skills and knowledge • Responsibility, accountability, and authority for performing the practices are assigned • The effectiveness of activities is evaluated and tracked Approach characteristic: • Practices are more complete or advanced than at MIL2 4.3 Approach Progression The domain-specific objectives and practices describe the progression of the approach to cybersecurity for each domain in the model. Approach refers to the completeness, thoroughness, or level of development of an activity in a domain. As an organization progresses from one MIL to the next, it will have more complete or more advanced implementations of the core activities in the domain. At MIL1, while only the initial set of practices for a domain is expected, an organization is not precluded from performing additional practices at higher MILs. To achieve MIL1, these initial activities may be performed in an ad hoc manner, but they must be performed. If an organization were to start with no capability in managing cybersecurity, it should focus initially on implementing the MIL1 practices. In the context of the model, ad hoc (that is, formed or used for a special purpose without policy or a plan for repetition) refers to performing a practice in a manner that depends largely on the initiative and experience of an individual or team (and team leadership), without much organizational guidance, such as a prescribed plan, policy, or training. The quality of the outcome may vary significantly depending on who performs the practice, when it is performed, the context of the problem being addressed, the methods, tools, and techniques used, and the priority given a particular instance of the practice. With experienced and talented personnel, high-quality outcomes may be achieved even if practices are ad hoc. However, at this MIL, lessons learned are typically not captured at the organizational level, so approaches and outcomes are difficult to repeat or improve across the organization. It is important to note that, while documented policies or procedures are not essential to the performance of a practice in 14 Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, Version 2.0 MODEL ARCHITECTURE an ad hoc manner, the effective performance of many practices would result in documented artifacts such as a documented asset inventory or a documented cybersecurity program strategy. Table 5 provides an example of the approach progression, Objective 1, in the Asset, Change, and Configuration Management domain. At MIL1, an inventory of IT and OT assets exists in any form and only for assets that are important to the delivery of the function. MIL2 adds more requirements to the inventory, including additional assets beyond those important to the delivery of the function and asset attributes. Finally, in addition to requiring performance of all MIL1 and MIL2 practices, MIL3 requires that the inventory includes all assets used for the delivery of the function and is updated based on defined triggers. Table 4: Example of Approach Progression in the ASSET Domain 1. Manage IT and OT Asset Inventory a. There is an inventory of IT and OT assets that are important to the delivery of the function; MIL1 management of the inventory may be ad hoc b. The IT and OT asset inventory includes assets within the function that may be leveraged to MIL2 achieve a threat objective c. The IT and OT inventory includes attributes that support cybersecurity activities (for example, location, asset priority, operating system and firmware versions) d. Inventoried IT and OT assets are prioritized based on defined criteria that include importance to the delivery of the function e. Prioritization criteria include consideration of assets within the function that may be leveraged to achieve a threat objective MIL3 f. The IT and OT asset inventory is complete (the inventory includes all assets used for the delivery of the function) g. The IT and OT asset inventory is current, that is, it is updated periodically and according to defined triggers, such as system changes h. The IT and OT asset inventory is used to identify cyber risks, such as asset end of life or end of support and single points of failure i. Data is destroyed or securely removed from IT and OT assets prior to redeployment and at end of life 4.4 Management Progression The management progression describes the extent to which a practice or activity is ingrained in an organization’s operations (or institutionalized). The more deeply ingrained an activity, the more likely it is that the organization will continue to perform the practice over time, the practice will be retained under times of stress, and the outcomes of the practice will be consistent, repeatable, and of high quality. The progression of imbedding an activity in an organization’s operations is described by a set of practices that can be performed to institutionalize the domain-specific practices. These 15 Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, Version 2.0 MODEL ARCHITECTURE practices are similar across domains and are called the Management Activities. Table 6 provides an example of the Management Activities in the ASSET domain. Table 5: Example of Management Activities in the ASSET Domain 5. Management Activities MIL1 No practice at MIL1 a. Documented procedures are established, followed, and maintained for activities in the ASSET MIL2 domain b. Adequate resources (people, funding, and tools) are provided to support activities in the ASSET domain c. Up-to-date policies or other organizational directives define requirements for activities in the MIL3 ASSET domain d. Personnel performing activities in the ASSET domain have the skills and knowledge needed to perform their assigned responsibilities e. Responsibility, accountability, and authority for the performance of activities in the ASSET domain are assigned to personnel f. The effectiveness of activities in the ASSET domain is evaluated and tracked 4.5 Example Lists Included in Practices Several practices within the domains include lists of examples to help illustrate the meaning of the practices. These example lists appear in line with practice text and are introduced by parenthetical statements “(for example,…)” or with the phrase “such as.” The purpose of these example lists is to better communicate the intended meaning of practices. Example lists should not be interpreted as a description of how a practice should be implemented. Each organization and function to which the model is applied is likely to have a unique risk profile and operating environment, and so the provided examples may not be applicable to all organizations and functions. Users of the C2M2 may leverage example lists to generate ideas about what considerations may be applicable, but should not interpret an example lists as indicating a minimum baseline or as an exhaustive list of what might be considered for implementation of a practice. Example: ASSET-1c The IT and OT inventory includes attributes that support cybersecurity activities (for example, location, asset priority, operating system and firmware versions) Figure 3: Example List in Practice ASSET-1c 4.6 Practice Reference Notation A number of practices within the domains are related to other model practices. When this occurs, the related practice is referenced using a notation that begins with the domain short name, a hyphen, the objective number, and the practice letter. Figure 4 shows an example 16 Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, Version 2.0 MODEL ARCHITECTURE from the first objective in the Asset, Change, and Configuration Management domain. The objective’s first practice, “There is an inventory of IT and OT assets that are important to the delivery of the function; management of the inventory may be ad hoc,” would be referenced elsewhere in the model using the notation “ASSET-1a.” Example: ASSET-1a Domain Short Name-Objective Number Practice Letter 1.

Data is destroyed or securely removed from IT and OT assets prior to redeployment and at end of life Figure 4: Example of Referencing an Individual Practice: ASSET-1a 17 Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, Version 2.0 USING THE MODEL 5. USING THE MODEL The C2M2 is meant to be used by an organization to evaluate its cybersecurity capabilities consistently, to communicate its capability levels in meaningful terms, and to inform the prioritization of its cybersecurity investments. Figure 5 summarizes a potential approach for using the model. An organization performs an evaluation against the model, uses that evaluation to identify gaps in capability, prioritizes those gaps and develops plans to address them, and finally implements plans to address the gaps. As plans are implemented, business objectives change, and the risk environment evolves, the process is repeated. Figure 5: Potential Approach for Using the Model 5.1 Step 1: Perform an Evaluation Performing a C2M2 self-evaluation provides a measurement of the implementation of cybersecurity activities within an organization. A design goal of the model is to enable organizations to complete a self-evaluation for a single function in one day without extensive study or preparation. To begin preparation, the organization first establishes the scope of the model application, or the function. Next, the organization should identify IT, OT, and information assets that are important to the delivery of the function. The organization should select the appropriate personnel to evaluate the in scope function against the model practices. An effective facilitator who is familiar with model content should be identified to guide the self-evaluation. Participation by stakeholders from across the 18 Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, Version 2.0 USING THE MODEL organization yields the best results and enables internal information sharing about the model practices. Personnel selected to participate in the self-evaluation should include operational personnel, management stakeholders, and any others who could provide useful information on the organization’s performance of cybersecurity practices in the model. Through open dialog and consensus, self-evaluation workshop participants decide on an implementation level for the practices in each domain. Responses are chosen from a four-point scale: Not Implemented, Partially Implemented, Largely Implemented, or Fully Implemented. Table 6 includes a description for each self-evaluation response option. Table 6: Description of Self-Evaluation Response Options Response Description Fully Implemented Complete Largely Implemented Complete, but with a recognized opportunity for improvement Partially Implemented Incomplete; there are multiple opportunities for improvement Not Implemented Absent; the practice is not performed by the organization Responses are recorded using one of the free C2M2 self-evaluation tools available from the DOE9 or using another tool. Upon completion of the self-evaluation, a scoring report is generated that provides summary-level depictions of performance relative to the model, as well as practice-level implementation status. This report provides a point-in-time view of the cybersecurity posture of the in-scope function. The report should be reviewed with the self- evaluation workshop participants, and any discrepancies or questions should be addressed. More thorough guidance on using the model, selecting a facilitator, and scoping the evaluation can be found in the supporting C2M2 Self-Evaluation Guide.10 5.2 Step 2: Analyze Identified Gaps The scoring report from the self-evaluation will identify gaps in the performance of model practices. The first analysis step for the organization is to determine whether these gaps are meaningful and important for the organization to address. It is not typically optimal for an organization to strive to achieve the highest MIL in all domains. Rather, the organization should determine the level of practice performance and MIL achievement for each domain that best enables it to meet its business objectives and cybersecurity strategy. The organization should identify its desired capability profile—a target MIL rating for each domain in the model. This collection of desired capabilities is the organization’s target profile. 9 The C2M2 self-evaluation tools may be obtained by sending a request to C2M2@hq.doe.gov or by visiting https://www.energy.gov/C2M2. 1 0 T h e C 2 M 2 S e lf - E v a l u a t io n G u i d e m a y b e d o wnloaded from https://www.energy.gov/C2M2. 19 Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, Version 2.0 USING THE MODEL For organizations using the model for the first time, a target profile is typically identified after the initial self-evaluation. This gives the organization an opportunity to develop more familiarity with the model. Organizations that have more experience with the model have often identified a target profile before undergoing an evaluation. The appropriate organizational stakeholders should select the target profile. This might be a single individual with expertise in the function’s operations and management, but it is likely to be a collection of individuals. The target profile can then be examined against the results from the self-evaluation workshop to identify gaps that are important to the organization because they represent differences from the desired capability profile. 5.3 Step 3: Prioritize and Plan After the gap analysis is complete, the organization should prioritize the actions needed to fully implement the practices that enable achievement of the desired capability in specific domains. The prioritization should be done using criteria such as how gaps affect organizational objectives, the importance of the business objective supported by the domain, the cost of implementing the necessary practices, and the availability of resources to implement the practices. A cost-benefit analysis for gaps and activities can inform the prioritization of the actions needed. Next, a plan should be developed to address the selected gaps. Planning should follow standard organizational planning processes and align to the strategic objectives of the organization and cybersecurity program. These plans can span a period of weeks, months, or years, depending on the extent of improvements needed to close the selected gaps and achieve the desired capability. An individual with sufficient authority to carry out the plan should be identified and assigned as the plan owner. Regular reviews by organizational leadership should be conducted to evaluate status, clear obstacles, and identify any necessary course corrections as implementation progresses. 5.4 Step 4: Implement Plans and Periodically Reevaluate Plans developed in the previous step should be implemented to address the identified gaps. Model self-evaluations are particularly useful in tracking implementations and should be conducted periodically to ensure that desired progress is achieved. Reevaluations should also be considered in response to major changes in business, technology, market, or threat environments to ensure that the current profile matches the organization’s desired state. 20 Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, Version 2.0 USING THE MODEL Table 7: Inputs, Activities, and Outputs: Breakdown of Potential Approach Inputs Activities Outputs 1.

However, in cases where assets are either unique efficiently managed. or must have individual configurations, managing asset configuration involves controlling the configuration baseline of the asset when it is deployed for operation and ensuring that the asset remains configured according to the baseline. 22 ASSET, CHANGE, AND CONFIGURATION Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, Version 2.0 MANAGEMENT (ASSET) Managing changes to assets includes analyzing requested changes to ensure they do not introduce unacceptable vulnerabilities into the operating environment, ensuring all changes follow the change management process, and identifying unauthorized changes.

A threat profile includes characterization of likely intent, capability, and target of threats to the function. The threat profile can be used to guide the identification of specific threats, the risk analysis process described in the Risk Management domain, and the building of the operational and cyber status described in the Situational Awareness domain. Reducing cybersecurity vulnerabilities begins with collecting and analyzing vulnerability information. Vulnerability discovery may be performed using automatic scanning tools, network penetration tests, cybersecurity exercises, and audits. Vulnerability analysis should consider the vulnerability’s local impact (the potential effect of the vulnerability on the exposed asset) as well as the importance of the asset to the delivery of the function. Vulnerabilities may be 26 THREAT AND VULNERABILITY Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, Version 2.0 MANAGEMENT (THREAT) addressed by implementing mitigating controls, monitoring threat status, applying cybersecurity patches, replacing outdated equipment, or performing other activities.

Risks are identified, categorized, and prioritized in a way that helps the organization consistently respond to and monitor risks. A risk register—a list of identified risks and associated attributes—also facilitates this process. Consolidation of risks into categories enables the organization to develop a risk register that is reflective of the current risk environment and can be managed effectively with available resources. Other domains in the 29 Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, Version 2.0 RISK MANAGEMENT (RISK) model (Situational Awareness, Event and Incident Response, Continuity of Operations, and Cybersecurity Architecture) refer to risk practices and illustrate how the practices in the model are strengthened as they connect through a cyber risk management program.

In some cases, organizations may organization’s assets aligns with access need to use shared identities. Management of shared requirements. identities may require compensatory measures to ensure an appropriate level of security. Maintenance of identities includes traceability (ensuring that all known identities are valid) as well as deprovisioning. Controlling logical and physical access includes determining access requirements, granting access to assets based on those requirements, and revoking access when it is no longer required. Logical and physical access requirements are associated with each asset or assets within a given area, and provide guidance for the types of entities or individuals allowed to access the asset, the limits of allowed access and, for logical access, authentication parameters. For example, the logical access requirements for a specific asset might allow remote access by a vendor only during specified and planned maintenance intervals and might also require multifactor authentication for such access. At higher maturity indicator levels, more scrutiny is applied to 33 IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, Version 2.0 (ACCESS) the access being granted. Logical and physical access is granted only after considering risk to the function, and regular reviews of access are conducted. Objectives and Practices 1. Establish and Maintain Identities MIL1 a.

Respond to Cybersecurity Events and Incidents response plan annually to ensure that its procedures are adequately 4. Address Cybersecurity in Continuity of Operations addressing all phases of the incident 5. Management Activities lifecycle. Detecting cybersecurity events includes designating a forum for reporting events and establishing criteria for event prioritization. These criteria should align with the cyber risk management strategy discussed in the Risk Management domain, ensure consistent valuation of events, and provide a means to determine what constitutes a cybersecurity event, when cybersecurity events are to be escalated, and the conditions that warrant the declaration of cybersecurity incidents. Cybersecurity events may originate with or impact third parties necessitating coordination in response planning, execution, and communications. Escalating cybersecurity events involves applying the criteria discussed in the Detect Cybersecurity Events objective to determine when an event should be escalated and when an incident should be declared. Both cybersecurity events and cybersecurity incidents should be managed according to a response plan. Cybersecurity events and declared incidents may trigger external obligations, including reporting to regulatory bodies or notifying customers. Correlating multiple cybersecurity events and incidents and other records may uncover systemic problems within the environment. 39 EVENT AND INCIDENT RESPONSE, CONTINUITY Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, Version 2.0 OF OPERATIONS (RESPONSE) Responding to cybersecurity incidents requires the organization to have a process to limit the impact of cybersecurity incidents to its functional and organizational units. The process should describe how the organization manages all phases of the incident lifecycle, such as triage, handling, communication, coordination, and closure. Conducting lessons-learned reviews as a part of cybersecurity event and incident response and continuity of operations helps the organization eliminate the exploited vulnerability that led to the incident. Planning for continuity involves the necessary activities to sustain the function in the event of an interruption, such as a severe cybersecurity incident or a disaster. Ensuring that continuity plans address potential cybersecurity incidents requires consideration of known cyber threats and identified categories of cyber risk. Continuity plan testing should include cybersecurity incident scenarios to ensure that plans will function as intended during such incidents. Objectives and Practices 1.

Identify and Prioritize Third Parties 2. Manage Third-Party Risk 3. Management Activities Identifying third parties involves establishing and maintaining a comprehensive understanding of the key external relationships required for the delivery of the function. After identification, third parties should be prioritized to determine which third-party dependencies are most critical to the delivery of the function. Prioritization criteria should consider the risk to the function that is introduced by third-party relationships. Managing third-party risk includes approaches such as independent testing, code review, scanning for vulnerabilities, and reviewing demonstrable evidence from the vendor that a secure software development process has been followed. Contracts binding the organization to a relationship with a partner or vendor for products or services should be reviewed and approved for cyber risk mitigation, such as contract language that establishes vendor responsibilities for meeting or exceeding specified cybersecurity standards or guidelines. Service level agreements can specify monitoring and audit processes to verify that vendors and service providers meet cybersecurity and other performance measures. Objectives and Practices 1. Identify and Prioritize Third Parties a. Important IT and OT third-party dependencies are identified (that is, internal and external MIL1 parties on which the delivery of the function depends, including operating partners), at least in an ad hoc manner b. Third parties that have access to, control of, or custody of any IT, OT, or information assets important to the delivery of the function are identified, at least in an ad hoc manner MIL2 c.

Management Activities the awareness and skills necessary to An important aspect of assigning cybersecurity responsibilities manage and protect the company’s is ensuring adequacy and redundancy of coverage. For assets, which may also contribute to the protection of interconnected example, specific workforce roles with significant cybersecurity critical infrastructure external to the responsibilities are often easy to determine, but they can be organization. challenging to maintain. It is vital to develop plans for key cybersecurity workforce roles such as system administrators to provide appropriate training, testing, redundancy, and evaluations of performance. Cybersecurity responsibilities are not restricted to traditional IT roles; for example, engineers, control room operators, and field technicians may have cybersecurity responsibilities. Developing the cybersecurity workforce includes training and recruiting to address identified skill gaps. For example, hiring practices should ensure that recruiters and interviewers are aware of cybersecurity workforce needs. Also, personnel (and contractors) should receive 46 WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, Version 2.0 (WORKFORCE) periodic security awareness training to reduce their vulnerability to social engineering and other threats. The effectiveness of training and awareness activities should be evaluated, and improvements should be made as needed. Implementing workforce controls includes personnel vetting, such as background checks, with extra vetting performed for positions that have access to assets needed to deliver an essential service. For example, system administrators typically have the ability to change configuration settings, modify or delete log files, create new accounts, and change passwords on critical systems, and specific measures are taken for protection of these systems from accidental or malicious behavior by this category of personnel. Increasing the cybersecurity awareness of the workforce is as important as technological approaches for improving the cybersecurity of the organization. The threat of a cyber attack to an organization often starts with gaining some foothold into a company’s IT or OT systems, for example, by gaining the trust of an unwary employee or contractor who then introduces media or devices into the organization’s networks. The organization should share information with its workforce on methods and techniques to identify suspicious behavior, avoid spam and spear phishing, and recognize social engineering attacks to avoid providing information about the organization to potential adversaries. For example, an internal website could provide information about new threats and vulnerabilities in the industry. If no information on threats, vulnerabilities, and best practices is shared with the workforce, personnel may become lax about security processes and procedures. Objectives and Practices 1.

See access control and asset. ad hoc In the context of the model, ad hoc (that is, formed or used for a special C2M2 purpose without policy or a plan for repetition) refers to performing a practice in a manner that depends largely on the initiative and experience of an individual or team (and team leadership), without much in the way of organizational guidance, such as a prescribed plan (verbal or written), policy, or training. The quality of the outcome may vary significantly depending on who performs the practice; when it is performed; the context of the problem being addressed; the methods, tools, and techniques used; and the priority given a particular instance of the practice. With experienced and talented personnel, high-quality outcomes may be achieved even if practices are ad hoc. However, because, in an ad hoc practice, lessons learned are typically not captured at the organizational level, approaches and outcomes are difficult to repeat or improve across the organization. It is important to note that, while documented policies or procedures are not essential to the performance of a practice in an ad hoc manner, the effective performance of many practices would result in documented artifacts such as a documented asset inventory or a documented cybersecurity program strategy. all assets used for All assets that are used in the normal state of operation of the function.

Each of the objectives in a domain comprises a set of practices, which are ordered by maturity indicator level. enterprise The highest level organizational unit that encompasses the part of the C2M2 organization using the C2M2. Some enterprises may consist of multiple organizations (e.g., a holding company with one or more operating companies). Other organizations may have a more homogenous structure that does not necessitate any differentiation between the terms enterprise and organization. For those organizations, enterprise and organization may be used interchangeably. See also organization. enterprise The design and description of an enterprise’s entire set of IT and OT Adapted from architecture assets: how they are configured, how they are integrated, how they DOE RMP interface to the external environment at the enterprise’s boundary, how they are operated to support the enterprise mission, and how they contribute to the enterprise’s overall security posture.

See also maturity indicator level. integrity Guarding against improper information modification or destruction. DOE RMP & Integrity includes ensuring information nonrepudiation and authenticity. CERT-RMM For an asset, integrity is the quality of being in the condition intended by the owner and therefore continuing to be useful for the purposes intended by the owner. 70 Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, Version 2.0 APPENDIX B: GLOSSARY Term Definition Source least privilege A security control that addresses the potential for abuse of authorized Adapted from privileges. The organization employs the concept of least privilege by NIST 800-53 allowing only authorized access for users (and processes acting on behalf of users) who require it to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with organizational missions and business functions. Organizations employ the concept of least privilege for specific duties and systems (including specific functions, ports, protocols, and services). The concept of least privilege is also applied to information system processes, ensuring that the processes operate at privilege levels no higher than necessary to accomplish required organizational missions and functions. Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles, and information system accounts as necessary to achieving least privilege. Organizations also apply least privilege concepts to the design, development, implementation, and operations of IT and OT systems. logging Logging typically refers to automated recordkeeping (by elements of an IT C2M2 or OT system) of system, network, or user activity. Logging may also refer to keeping a manual record, such as a sign-in sheet, of physical access by personnel to a protected asset or restricted area, although automated logging of physical access activity is commonplace. Regular review and audit of logs (manually or by automated tools) is a critical monitoring activity that is essential for situational awareness, such as through the detection of cybersecurity events or weaknesses. logical control A software, firmware, or hardware feature (that is, computational logic, Adapted from not a physical obstacle) within an IT or OT system that restricts access to CNSSI 4009 and modification of assets only to authorized entities.

The model currently defines four maturity indicator levels (MILs). Each of the four defined levels is designated by a number (0 through 3) and a name, for example, “MIL3: managed.” A MIL is a measure of the progression within a domain from individual and team initiative, as a basis for carrying out cybersecurity practices, to organizational policies and procedures that institutionalize those practices, making them repeatable with a consistently high level of quality. As an organization progresses from one MIL to the next, the organization will have more complete or more advanced implementations of the activities in the domain. monitoring Collecting, recording, and distributing information about the behavior and Adapted from activities of systems and persons to support the continuous process of CERT-RMM identifying and analyzing risks to organizational assets and critical (Monitoring and infrastructure that could adversely affect the operation and delivery of Risk services.

For example, a shift from the normal state of operation to a high-security operating mode may be invoked in response to a declared cybersecurity incident of sufficient severity. The high- security operating state may trade off efficiency and ease of use in favor of increased security by blocking remote access and requiring a higher level of authentication and authorization for certain commands until a return to the normal state of operation is deemed safe. privacy The assurance that information about an individual is collected, used, and C2M2 disclosed only as authorized by that individual or as permitted under privacy laws and regulations. procedure In the model, procedure is synonymous with process. process A series of discrete activities or tasks that contribute to the fulfillment of a CERT-RMM task or mission.
