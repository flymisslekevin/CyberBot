..................................................... 64 Version 2023-03-01 © 2024 - Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium  CyberFundamentals IMPORTANT Introduction The CyberFundamentals Framework is a set of concrete measures to: • protect data, • significantly reduce the risk of the most common cyber-attacks, • increase an organisation's cyber resilience. The requirements and guidance are complemented with the relevant insights included in NIST/CSF framework, ISO 27001/ISO 27002, IEC 62443 and the CIS Critical security Controls (ETSI TR 103 305-1). The coding of the requirements corresponds with the codes used in the NIST CSF Framework. Since not all NIST CSF requirements are applicable, some codes that do exist in the NIST CSF framework may be missing. The framework and the proportional approach of the assurance levels are validated by practitioners in the field and by using anonymized real-world cyber-attack information provided by the federal Cyber Emergency Response Team (CERT - the operational service of the Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium). The CyberFundamentals Framework is built around five core functions: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. These functions allow, regardless of the organization and industry, to promote communication around cybersecurity among both technical practitioners and stakeholders so that cyber-related risks can be incorporated into the overall risk management strategy of the organization. • Identify Know important cyber threats to your most valuable assets. Essentially, you can't protect what you don't know exists. This function helps develop an organizational understanding of how to manage cyber security risks related to systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities. • Protect The protect function focuses on developing and implementing the safeguards necessary to mitigate or contain a cyber risk. • Detect The purpose of the Detect function is to ensure the timely detection of cyber security events. • Respond The Respond function is all about the controls that help respond to cyber security incidents. The Respond function supports the ability to contain the impact of a potential cyber security incident. • Recover The Recover function focuses on those safeguards that help maintain resilience and restore services that have been affected by a cyber security incident. To respond to the severity of the threat an organisation is exposed to, in addition to the starting level Small, 3 assurance levels are provided: Basic, Important and Essential. The starting level Small allows an organisation to make an initial assessment. It is intended for micro- organisations or organisations with limited technical knowledge. The assurance level Basic contains the standard information security measures for all enterprises. These provide an effective security value with technology and processes that are generally already available. Where justified, the measures are tailored and refined. Version 2023-03-01 © 2024 - Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium  CyberFundamentals IMPORTANT Building on the Basic level, security measures are supplemented to protect organisations from increased cyber risks to achieve a higher level of assurance. The assurance level Important is designed to minimise the risks of targeted cyber-attacks by actors with common skills and resources in addition to known cyber security risks. Several controls require particular attention; These measures are labelled as - key measure -. The framework is a living document and will continue to be updated and improved considering the feedback received from stakeholders, evolving risk of specific cybersecurity threats, availability of technical solutions and progressive insight. Version 2023-03-01 © 2024 - Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium  CyberFundamentals Identify (ID) IMPORTANT Asset Management (ID.AM) The data, personnel, devices, systems, and facilities that enable the organization to achieve business purposes are identified and managed consistent with their relative importance to organizational objectives and the organization’s risk strategy. ID.AM-1: Physical devices and systems used within the organization are inventoried. An inventory of assets associated with information and information processing facilities within the organization shall be documented, reviewed, and updated when changes occur. Guidance • This inventory includes fixed and portable computers, tablets, mobile phones, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), sensors, actuators, robots, machine tools, firmware, network switches, routers, power supplies, and other networked components or devices. • This inventory must include all assets, whether or not they are connected to the organization's network. • The use of an IT asset management tool could be considered. The inventory of assets associated with information and information processing facilities shall reflect changes in the organization’s context and include all information necessary for effective accountability. Guidance • Inventory specifications include for example, manufacturer, device type, model, serial number, machine names and network addresses, physical location… • Accountability is the obligation to explain, justify, and take responsibility for one's actions, it implies answerability for the outcome of the task or process. • Changes include the decommissioning of material. When unauthorized hardware is detected, it shall be quarantined for possible exception handling, removed, or replaced, and the inventory shall be updated accordingly. Guidance • Any unsupported hardware without an exception documentation, is designated as unauthorized. • Unauthorized hardware can be detected during inventory, requests for support by the user or other means.

An inventory that reflects what software platforms and applications are being used in the organization shall be documented, reviewed, and updated when changes occur. Guidance • This inventory includes software programs, software platforms and databases, even if outsourced (SaaS). • Outsourcing arrangements should be part of the contractual agreements with the provider. • Information in the inventory should include for example: name, description, version, number of users, data processed, etc. • A distinction should be made between unsupported software and unauthorized software. • The use of an IT asset management tool could be considered. The inventory of software platforms and applications associated with information and information processing shall reflect changes in the organization’s context and include all information necessary for effective accountability. Guidance The inventory of software platforms and applications should include the title, publisher, initial install/use date, and business purpose for each entry; where appropriate, include the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), app store(s), version(s), deployment mechanism, and decommission date. Individuals who are responsible and who are accountable for administering software platforms and applications within the organization shall be identified. Guidance There are no additional guidelines. When unauthorized software is detected, it shall be quarantined for possible exception handling, removed, or replaced, and the inventory shall be updated accordingly. Guidance • Any unsupported software without an exception documentation, is designated as unauthorized. • Unauthorized software can be detected during inventory, requests for support by the user or other means.

Information that the organization stores and uses shall be identified. Guidance • Start by listing all the types of information your business stores or uses. Define “information type” in any useful way that makes sense to your business. You may want to have your employees make a list of all the information they use in their regular activities. List everything you can think of, but you do not need to be too specific. For example, you may keep customer names and email addresses, receipts for raw material, your banking information, or other proprietary information. • Consider mapping this information with the associated assets identified in the inventories of physical devices, systems, software platforms and applications used within the organization (see ID.AM-1 & ID.AM-2). All connections within the organization's ICT/OT environment, and to other organization- internal platforms shall be mapped, documented, approved, and updated as appropriate. Guidance • Connection information includes, for example, the interface characteristics, data characteristics, ports, protocols, addresses, description of the data, security requirements, and the nature of the connection. • Configuration management can be used as supporting asset. • This documentation should not be stored only on the network it represents. • Consider keeping a copy of this documentation in a safe offline environment (e.g. offline hard disk, paper hardcopy, …) References CIS Controls V8 (ETSI TR 103 305 1 V4.1.1), Critical Security Control 12 IEC 62443-2-1:2010, Clause 4.2.3.4 ISO/IEC 27001:2022 (NBN ISO/IEC 27001:2023), Annex A (see ISO 27002) ISO/IEC 27002:2022 (NBN EN ISO/IEC 27002:2022), Control 5.14 ID.AM-4: External information systems are catalogued. The organization shall map, document, authorize and when changes occur, update, all external services and the connections made with them. Guidance • Outsourcing of systems, software platforms and applications used within the organization is covered in ID.AM-1 & ID.AM-2 • External information systems are systems or components of systems for which organizations typically have no direct supervision and authority over the application of security requirements and controls, or the determination of the effectiveness of implemented controls on those systems i.e., services that are run in cloud, SaaS, hosting or other external environments, API (Application Programming Interface)… • Mapping external services and the connections made to them and authorizing them in advance avoids wasting unnecessary resources investigating a supposedly non-authenticated connection to external systems.

The organization’s resources (hardware, devices, data, time, personnel, information, and software) shall be prioritized based on their classification, criticality, and business value. Guidance • Determine organization’s resources (e.g., hardware, devices, data, time, personnel, information, and software): What would happen to my business if these resources were made public, damaged, lost…? o What would happen to my business when the integrity of resources is no longer guaranteed? o What would happen to my business if I/my customers couldn’t access these resources? And rank these o resources based on their classification, criticality, and business value. • Resources should include enterprise assets. • Create a classification for sensitive information by first determining categories, e.g. Public - freely accessible to all, even externally o Internal - accessible only to members of your organization o Confidential - accessible only to those whose duties require access. o • Communicate these categories and identify what types of data fall into these categories (HR data, financial data, legal data, personal data, etc.). • Consider the use of the Traffic Light Protocol (TLP). • Data classification should apply to the three aspects: C-I-A.

Guidance Consider to: • Communicate and discuss regularly to ensure that everyone is aware of their responsibilities. • Develop an outreach program by gathering in a document the messages you want to convey to your staff (topics, audiences, objectives, etc.) and your communication rhythm on a calendar (weekly, monthly, one-time, etc.). Communicate continuously and in an engaging way, involving management, IT colleagues, the ICT service provider and HR and Communication managers. • Cover topics such as: recognition of fraud attempts, phishing, management of sensitive information, incidents, etc. The goal is for all employees to understand ways to protect company information. • Discuss with your management, your ICT colleagues, or your ICT service provider some practice scenarios (e.g. what to do if a virus alert is triggered, if a storm cuts off the power, if data is blocked, if an account is hacked, etc.), determine what behaviours to adopt, document and communicate them to all your staff. The central point of contact in the event of an incident should be known to all. • Organize a simulation of a scenario to test your knowledge. Consider performing the exercise for example at least once a year.
