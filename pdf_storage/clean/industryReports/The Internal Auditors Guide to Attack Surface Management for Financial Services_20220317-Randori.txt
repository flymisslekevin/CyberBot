The industry collects, transmits, and processes customer data that threat actors often target. Simultaneously, it’s one of the most highly regulated industries that needs to engage in annual federal agency audits while also meeting industry standards. Mapping multiple standards and documenting activities is time consuming. The needs of performing this work unfortunately removes key employees from their daily tasks, which increases the costs of compliance across the organizations. However, compliance violations lead to fines, or even worse, Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) which might mean the business can no longer function. Although many compliance mandates may appear to conflict, compliance only acts as a minimum baseline for security. Using Attack Surface Management (ASM) as part of a security-first approach to compliance allows a financial services institution to go beyond the minimum baselines security controls outlined in most compliance mandates for a more robust approach to security and compliance.

Unlike other industries, financial services institutions may have both federal and state level regulators. Further, industry standard best practices may also need to be considered. Knowing the Regulators All financial services institutions - whether banking or non-bank designated - will have a federal regulator. The first step is knowing which one applies to the organization. Most likely, a financial institution will need to interact with one of the following: • Federal Reserve Board (FRB): state-chartered member banks, bank holding companies, U.S. national and state member banks’ foreign branches, EDGE Act corporations, and state-chartered U.S. branches of agencies and foreign banks • Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC): U.S. depository institutions, including banks, credit unions, non-bank financial institutions • Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC): all national banks and federal savings associations, including federal branches and agencies of foreign banks • Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS): federally chartered and state-chartered savings banks as well as savings and loans associations. • Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA): brokerage firms and exchange markets, non-governmental organization • National Credit Union Administration (NCUA): federal credit unions RRAANNDDOORRII..CCOOMM THE INTERNAL AUDITOR’S GUIDE TO ATTACK SURFACE MANAGEMENT FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES 6 Even fintech companies are being regulated today, including With so many different regulatory crypto companies.1 As regulators requirements, a company needs take more interest in different to fit together the puzzle pieces, types of financial services, especially when looking at more companies that touch this cybersecurity and IT. space may need to consider new compliance requirements. KNOWING THE REGULATIONS In conjunction with different regulators, financial AND STANDARDS institutions also have to understand the different regulations that impact them. Some of the regulations are focused on the industry, but others apply to how an organization is structured. With so many different regulatory requirements, a company needs to fit together the puzzle pieces, especially when looking at cybersecurity and IT. RANDORI.COM THE INTERNAL AUDITOR’S GUIDE TO ATTACK SURFACE MANAGEMENT FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES 7 Knowing the Regulators At the federal level, regulatory requirements focus on industry and financial reporting laws. Financial reporting laws overlap with cybersecurity and privacy requirements, especially since they focus on ensuring data integrity. The compliance mandates from the federal financial regulators include: • The FFIEC Audit Manual2: primary guide for federal regulatory audits, includes “Information Security Booklet3” guiding security audits • NCUA Examiner’s Guide4: Framework for credit unions to manage cybersecurity risk but has not been updated since June 2002 and may not reflect regulatory or policy changes made since then • NCUA Appendix A to Part 7485: 2019 update referencing FFIEC Manual as the guidelines for managing security In addition, depending on the organization’s structure and how information sharing is established, it may also need to comply with: • Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)6: Amended to include “Cybersecurity Systems and Risk Reporting Act7” in 2017 as part of financial reporting for publicly held organizations • The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (also called the Financial Modernization Act)8: Amended with the “Security Rule9” which focuses on cybersecurity controls to protect data shared between organizations RANDORI.COM TTHHEE IINNTTEERRNNAALL AAUUDDIITTOORR’’SS GGUUIIDDEE TTOO AATTTTAACCKK SSUURRFFAACCEE MMAANNAAGGEEMMEENNTT FFOORR FFIINNAANNCCIIAALL SSEERRVVIICCEESS 88 Additional Compliance Mandates Beyond just the federal laws governing financial services institutions, industry standards and state laws also apply. These may include: • New York Department of Financial Services (NY DFS) Cybersecurity Rule10: Standard for monitoring controls and reporting breaches • Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)11: Prescriptive controls for managing the privacy and security of cardholder data • General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)12: Privacy standard for managing customer data and established extraterritorial jurisdiction • California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)13: Privacy standard with extraterritorial jurisdiction and right of private action over California consumer data RRAANNDDOORRII..CCOOMM TTHHEE IINNTTEERRNNAALL AAUUDDIITTOORR’’SS GGUUIIDDEE TTOO AATTTTAACCKK SSUURRFFAACCEE MMAANNAAGGEEMMEENNTT FFOORR FFIINNAANNCCIIAALL SSEERRVVIICCEESS 99 Industry Challenges: Financial Services With data breaches continuously in the news, federal and state legislators are playing catch-up, trying to create a public sense of accountability. Information security compliance will become more, rather than less, challenging as a result of this shift in the regulatory environment. Companies need to prove governance over their security posture to keep up. Unfortunately, as the organization adds more technologies, they often struggle to focus on the most at- risk assets when trying to meet compliance requirements. The barrier to effective governance can be especially acute at smaller financial organizations that lack the resources of the major banks and financial institutions. The dynamic nature of today’s attack surface means that many financial institutions lack visibility into their internet-facing IT assets. RRAANNDDOORRII..CCOOMM THE INTERNAL AUDITOR’S GUIDE TO ATTACK SURFACE MANAGEMENT FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES 10 THE GROWING Digital transformation generates revenue by, among other things, ATTACK SURFACE providing additional financial product offerings and ensuring employee productivity. Simultaneously, dynamic cloud-based resources like Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a- 1 3 in Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) increase the number of access points and generate high volumes of log data. External Assets Is Unknown to As the number and type of internet-facing assets expands, Security organizations struggle to establish consistent, repeatable technology governance processes. The resulting lack of coherence unfortunately increases the potential for a compliance violation. LACK OF VISIBILITY The dynamic nature of today’s attack surface means that many financial institutions lack visibility into their internet-facing IT assets. These externally-facing assets are the same ones that <9% attackers will target in order to create a beachhead within a financial company’s critical systems. Organizations need to of Organizations know what attackers can see, not just at a moment in time, but Believe They continuously so they can effectively mitigate the risk of a Monitor 100% cyber incident. of Their Attack Surface To gain the visibility needed for compliance, financial institutions need to use a combination of threat intelligence so that they can understand adversary tactics, techniques, and practices (TTPs), and automated discovery to ensure they are perpetually uncovering any new assets attached to their organization. The attack surface is always changing, whether it’s new IT-owned assets or software that business units download without the knowledge of central IT. Any of those changes limit visibility and increase risk. RANDORI.COM THE INTERNAL AUDITOR’S GUIDE TO ATTACK SURFACE MANAGEMENT FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES 11 CONTINUOUS Nearly every compliance mandate requires continuous MONITORING monitoring. Problematically, cloud-based resources generate so much data that security teams end up with high volumes of alerts, many of which are false positives. To meet compliance 7 10 in requirements, they need to prove that they can detect, investigate, and respond to all potential risks and threats. Organizations Have Been Compromised As part of this, IT teams need to test their people, processes, By An Unmanaged and security technologies. Unfortunately, while penetration tests Asset in Past Year provide the needed validation, they are time-consuming and expensive, making them cost-prohibitive beyond once or twice per year. UNMANAGED Unmanaged or poorly managed assets present the most ASSETS substantive risk of a cyber incident. It is incredibly easy for business units to implement their own technologies outside the control of central IT. These assets are too often excluded from <5% asset management systems, thereby limiting the ability of IT and security teams to fully account for risk. Organizations may be of Vulnerabilities able to scan their networks, but that is only one type of collection Are Ever Exploited tactic that adversaries use to determine their targeting. in the Wild Financial institutions struggle to discover all external systems, especially when new cloud assets can easily be created. For example, a workload may be spun up without assigning a responsible party, leaving the asset unmanaged. Threat actors can exploit the asset, and the organization may not be able to trace the root cause. RANDORI.COM THE INTERNAL AUDITOR’S GUIDE TO ATTACK SURFACE MANAGEMENT FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES 12 PRIORITIZATION To meet compliance requirements, financial institutions need to know how to allocate their resources. To do this, they need a way to prioritize vulnerabilities because even a known vulnerability may not be exploitable within an organization’s unique stack. Understanding the actual risk of a vulnerability being exploited is critical for the modern security leader. Only 5% of reported vulnerabilities are ever actually used in the wild, which means that even a CVE with a score of Critical may not really impact your organization. To maintain security as part of a robust compliance posture, organizations need to consider multiple factors when trying to understand the likelihood that malicious actors will target them. For example, assets that enable attackers to escalate privileges should be prioritized. Additionally, organizations may need to more accurately determine their critical assets and protect those with different defense-in-depth tactics as opposed to assets that are not as central to continued operations. Those assets that are determined as business-critical should be more closely protected than other, less critical assets.

All federal regulators use this to define scope and testing. In addition, the FFIEC “Information Security Booklet” offers an overarching framework that aligns to the best practices set out in other regulations like SOX, GLBA, NY DFS Cybersecurity Rule, and GDPR. Understanding the requirements for establishing best practices under the FFIEC “Information Security Booklet” can help you mature your security and compliance. To help you get the most out of this booklet, we’ve summarized the relevant sections. RRAANNDDOORRII..CCOOMM THE INTERNAL AUDITOR’S GUIDE TO ATTACK SURFACE MANAGEMENT FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES 14 SECTION II INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM MANAGEMENT Under this section, financial institutions need to: • Identify risk: Risk identification includes the ability to identify threats using threat intelligence tools, reviewing the IT infrastructure for exploitable vulnerabilities, and supervising and managing risk. Doing this effectively ensures that financial organizations have an accurate picture of the risks facing their systems. • Measure risk: Risk measurement can include several dimensions, including mapping threats and vulnerabilities, reviewing legal and regulatory requirements, and improving the consistency of risk measurement. It also means highlighting mitigations, setting controls, and comparing the threats and mitigating controls to ensure the desired functionality. • Mitigate risk: Lastly, risk mitigation features such tactics as setting controls, alongside establishing a technology design process and inventorying and classifying assets. Financial organizations seeking to mitigate risk could also monitor physical security, establish user security controls, and manage supply chain risk. Some other actions under this section include: » Mitigating interconnectivity risk » Reviewing database security » Establishing change management » Using encryption processes » Overseeing third-party service » Managing end-of-life providers » Controlling information » Establishing a business continuity plan » Managing supply chain risk » Ensuring log management » Setting logical security controls capabilities » Mitigating risk from customer remote » Monitoring and reporting risk access to financial services with metrics » Monitoring application security RANDORI.COM TTHHEE IINNTTEERRNNAALL AAUUDDIITTOORR’’SS GGUUIIDDEE TTOO AATTTTAACCKK SSUURRFFAACCEE MMAANNAAGGEEMMEENNTT FFOORR FFIINNAANNCCIIAALL SSEERRVVIICCEESS 1155 Attack Surface Management Fundamentally, the lack of visibility into assets for Managing Risk and ability to manage them across a complex attack surface makes complying with the FFIEC audit requirements a challenge. For example, under section “II.C.13 Control of Information,” the “Information Security Booklet” specifically calls out “Rogue or Shadow IT.” As companies expand their digital footprint, manual processes and multiple vendor-supplied solutions make compliance documentation overwhelming and time consuming. A new category of software solutions, called attack surface management (ASM) solutions, provide a way to automate and streamline management of the financial organization’s internet-exposed footprint. ASM solutions typically operate in concert with asset management and SIEM tools, augmenting those existing tools with additional data. As companies expand their digital footprint, manual processes and multiple vendor-supplied solutions make compliance documentation overwhelming and time consuming.

Financial institutions need visibility into their attack surface to continuously monitor for new threats. Additionally, financial institutions need technologies that help them rapidly detect, investigate, and respond to new threats as a way to stop an attack rapidly. RRAANNDDOORRII..CCOOMM THE INTERNAL AUDITOR’S GUIDE TO ATTACK SURFACE MANAGEMENT FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES 18 ASM provides capabilities that • Ongoing discovery: Discovering new assets enable robust security continuously, beyond the initial discovery scan operations, including: • Change monitoring: Monitoring and tracking changes, like new assets or risks impacting the attack surface • Alerting: Automating the alerts when the solution discovers changes on the perimeter • False positive and noise reduction: » Ensuring assets discovered belong to the organization » Ensuring assets are active » Assessing the the validity of the asset’s risk ASM provides advanced alerting • Change monitoring: capabilities for security • Monitoring and tracking newfound assets or operations, including: impactful risk changes over time • Providing dashboard and alerts for change monitoring • Communicating: Sharing discoveries or changes using email, APIs, or in-application mechanisms RANDORI.COM THE INTERNAL AUDITOR’S GUIDE TO ATTACK SURFACE MANAGEMENT FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES 19 SECTION IV INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS Under this section, financial institutions need to perform: • Self-assessments • Vulnerability assessments • Penetration tests • Independent third-party audits Attack Surface Management for Information Security Program Effectiveness Possibly the most challenging part, ensuring information security program effectiveness means providing documentation proving the organization’s activities protect data. As the digital footprint increases, this documentation is difficult to collect. Further, when auditors send out their initial request for documentation, security teams often spend more time gathering information than doing their security work. ASM provides capabilities for • Detailed artifacts on discovered assets documenting information security • Documentation over how assets were program effectiveness, including: discovered, including cloud assets • Dashboards to show risk of exploit, allowing for risk-based vulnerability management • Ability to adjust and manage risk based on business value and workflow status • Real-time communication of new risks to prove team’s responsiveness RANDORI.COM TTHHEE IINNTTEERRNNAALL AAUUDDIITTOORR’’SS GGUUIIDDEE TTOO AATTTTAACCKK SSUURRFFAACCEE MMAANNAAGGEEMMEENNTT FFOORR FFIINNAANNCCIIAALL SSEERRVVIICCEESS 2200 How to Choose an ASM Solution A FEW OF THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ASM solutions are a new cybersecurity product ABOUT ASM category that focus on providing visibility into the risks associated with internet-exposed • What details does it cyber assets.

An ASM solution should provide automated, continuous discovery designed to enhance visibility into the external attack surface. This should help financial services companies limit shadow IT risk by bringing unmanaged or poorly managed assets at least to the attention of central IT. In terms of specific details, asset discovery should include: • Externally-facing assets • Artifacts • Service information • Path used to assign artifacts For example, some information that it should provide includes: • Resource name • Version • Configuration details Without the ability to enumerate assets, the organization is unable to truly see what a threat actor sees. The ASM solution needs to provide this visibility so that the organization can identify, prioritize, and mitigate the risk. Otherwise, alerts become meaningless and leave the security operations function at risk of noncompliance. When looking for • Document all information about the asset for assigning the an ASM solution, appropriate risk rating organizations should • Provide visibility into potentially unmanaged assets look for one that can: • Incorporate into alerting for threat detection, investigation, and mitigation RRAANNDDOORRII..CCOOMM THE INTERNAL AUDITOR’S GUIDE TO ATTACK SURFACE MANAGEMENT FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES 22 HOW EASY IS IT FOR THE THREAT ACTOR TO USE THE VULNERABILITY? Despite the vast amount of vulnerabilities discovered, only 1 in 20 are ever exploited by attackers. There are good reasons for why this is, including that a vulnerability may be extremely difficult to exploit. The more resources a malicious actor needs to expend trying to exploit a vulnerability, the less lucrative the exploit is, thus making it unattractive. A critical CVE may not be exploitable within an organization’s technology stack because of any number of factors, such as requiring admin privileges before exploit or the system has been sufficiently cut off from the rest of the organization. Meanwhile, a low or medium risk CVE may be more exploitable in a company’s environment and more attractive to threat actors. To prioritize responses effectively, organizations need visibility into how exploitability impacts risk identification, security operations, and information security program effectiveness requirements. When looking for • Assign risk scores based on 1 20 Just in an ASM solution, actual exploit potential, not organizations should just CVSS score vulnerabilities are ever look for one that can: exploited in the wild • Help organizations prioritize vulnerabilities based on business risk • Provide visibility into what would be required as the next step after exploit RANDORI.COM TTHHEE IINNTTEERRNNAALL AAUUDDIITTOORR’’SS GGUUIIDDEE TTOO AATTTTAACCKK SSUURRFFAACCEE MMAANNAAGGEEMMEENNTT FFOORR FFIINNAANNCCIIAALL SSEERRVVIICCEESS 2233 HOW IMPORTANT IS THE ASSET TO THE BUSINESS? Across the FFIEC IT Information Security Booklet, nearly every requirement maps back to business criticality. A financial institution needs to understand a technology’s criticality in relation to daily operations. When thinking about criticality, an organization should consider how a successful attack would impact business continuity. An ASM should provide visibility into criticality as part of its prioritization and risk rating capabilities. When looking for • Empower the business to proactively define which an ASM solution, assets are critical to the business organizations should • Track changes in the external attack surface for look for one that can: critical assets • Offer flexibility as the nature of the attack surface changes RRAANNDDOORRII..CCOOMM TTHHEE IINNTTEERRNNAALL AAUUDDIITTOORR’’SS GGUUIIDDEE TTOO AATTTTAACCKK SSUURRFFAACCEE MMAANNAAGGEEMMEENNTT FFOORR FFIINNAANNCCIIAALL SSEERRVVIICCEESS 2244 HOW COMMON IS THE ASSET? Most threat actors are financially motivated, treating attacks like a business. The more time and resources they expend, the less income they generate. This is another reason that not all critical vulnerabilities are the same risk level. Often, threat actors will focus on commonly used assets, like software, so that they can attack multiple organizations using the same attack path before the vulnerability is patched. The more common the asset is, the greater risk the vulnerability poses to the financial organization. When looking for • Determine risk score based on commonality of an ASM solution, the asset organizations should • Assess likelihood of the particular asset look for one that can: being exploited • Provide guidance for financial organizations to make a risk management decision RRAANNDDOORRII..CCOOMM THE INTERNAL AUDITOR’S GUIDE TO ATTACK SURFACE MANAGEMENT FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES 25 HOW EASY IS IT TO STAY HIDDEN AND CONTINUE ALONG THE ATTACK PATH? Reconnaissance is the first step to an attack. Most threat actors want to stay hidden and move within systems, elevating privileges as a way to steal sensitive information. Remaining undetected is a primary goal because the longer the attacker dwells in systems and networks, the more valuable the attack is. Many metrics used by security operations to prove the information security program’s effectiveness map to this threat actor goal. For example, longer Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR) can lead to audit comments when used as part of the security program evaluation process. When looking for • Enumerate all internet-facing assets, not just an ASM solution, endpoints, servers, and cloud workloads organizations should • Determine the real risk of post-exploit potential in a look for one that can: cyber-asset • Allow organizations to accurately make decisions about their internet-exposed assets RANDORI.COM TTHHEE IINNTTEERRNNAALL AAUUDDIITTOORR’’SS GGUUIIDDEE TTOO AATTTTAACCKK SSUURRFFAACCEE MMAANNAAGGEEMMEENNTT FFOORR FFIINNAANNCCIIAALL SSEERRVVIICCEESS 2266 HOW MUCH TIME AND SKILL WILL IT TAKE TO RESEARCH A WAY TO EXPLOIT THE ASSET? If exploiting a vulnerability is complex or requires special skills, then threat actors are less likely to use it as an entry point. Even with a critical vulnerability embedded in it, an asset may be at a lower risk of exploitation. Financial institutions need visibility into the time and skill researching the exploit takes when they rate risk, determine risk tolerance, set controls, and monitor systems. When looking for • Score vulnerabilities based on real risk metrics an ASM solution, based on the attacker’s perspective organizations should • Illuminate the steps attackers would need to take to look for one that can: exploit the asset • Provide guidance for how easy or complex an asset would be to exploit RRAANNDDOORRII..CCOOMM TTHHEE IINNTTEERRNNAALL AAUUDDIITTOORR’’SS GGUUIIDDEE TTOO AATTTTAACCKK SSUURRFFAACCEE MMAANNAAGGEEMMEENNTT FFOORR FFIINNAANNCCIIAALL SSEERRVVIICCEESS 2277 Conclusion: Randori for Financial Services In order to know where attackers will strike, you first need to know how they view your external attack surface. With business changes, cloud migration, shadow IT, and M&A, your perimeter is constantly changing. Often escaping vulnerability scans and yearly assessments, these changes represent windows of opportunities for attackers looking to bypass your defenses. The Randori platform, including Recon and Attack, is designed to provide this attacker’s perspective to defenders so they can better prepare their security stack to prevent attacks. Just like real threat actors, Randori continuously monitors your external attack surface, looking for unexpected changes. Financial services companies can uncover blind spots, misconfigurations, and process failures they would have otherwise missed with Randori’s real-time attack surface monitoring, vulnerability intelligence and risk management capabilities.
