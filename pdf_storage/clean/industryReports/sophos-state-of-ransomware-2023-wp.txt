The State of Ransomware 2023 Findings from an independent, vendor-agnostic survey of 3,000 leaders responsible for IT/cybersecurity across 14 countries, conducted in January-March 2023. A Sophos Whitepaper. May 2023 The State of Ransomware 2023 Introduction Sophos’ annual study of the real-world ransomware experiences of IT/cybersecurity leaders makes clear the realities facing organizations in 2023. It reveals the most 3,000 common root causes of attacks and shines new light on how experiences with respondents ransomware differ based on organization revenue. The report also reveals the business and operational impact of paying the ransom to recover data rather than using backups. 14 countries About the Survey Sophos commissioned an independent, vendor-agnostic survey of 3,000 IT/ 100-5,000 cybersecurity leaders in organizations with between 100 and 5,000 employees employee organizations across 14 countries in the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific. The survey was conducted between January and March 2023, and respondents were asked to Jan-Mar 2023 respond based on their experiences over the previous year. research conducted Within the education sector, respondents were split into lower education (catering to students up to 18 years) and higher education (for students over 18 years). <$10M - $5B+ annual revenue A Sophos Whitepaper.

May 2023 The State of Ransomware 2023 Rate of Ransomware Attacks Attacks by Industry The research revealed that the rate of ransomware attacks has remained The education sector was the most likely to have experienced a ransomware attack level, with 66% of respondents reporting that their organization was hit by in the last year with 80% (lower education) and 79% (higher education) reporting ransomware in the previous year, the same as in our 2022 survey. With being hit. Education traditionally struggles with lower levels of resourcing and adversaries now able to consistently execute attacks at scale, ransomware is technology than many other industries, and the data shows that adversaries are arguably the biggest cyber risk facing organizations today. exploiting these weaknesses.

Singapore reported the highest rate of ransomware attacks in this year’s study, with 84% of organizations being hit in the previous year. Conversely, the UK reported the lowest rate of attack (44%). Austria reported the biggest drop in rate of attack, down from 84% of organizations hit to 50%. South Africa had the biggest increase in attack rate, with 78% of organizations hit in our 2023 survey compared to 51% in 2022.

May 2023 The State of Ransomware 2023 Attacks by Organization Size: Employees vs. Revenue Percentage of Organizations Hit by Ransomware by Revenue The research revealed a clear correlation between annual revenue and propensity to experience a ransomware attack, with the percentage of organizations hit by ransomware increasing progressively with revenue. 56% 72% of organizations with revenue of $10-$50 million experienced a ransomware 69% attack in the last year, rising to 72% of those with revenue of $5 billion plus. 67% 67% 63% Conversely, there was little clear relationship between experiencing 58% 56% ransomware and the number of employees in an organization. Outside the 1,001-3,000 employee segment, the rate of ransomware attack was very consistent: Ì 100-250 employees 62% Ì 251-500 employees 62% Ì 501-1,000 employees 62% Ì 1,001 – 3,000 employees 73% Ì 3,001 – 5,000 employees 63% The data makes clear that in the context of organization size, annual revenue is a much greater indicator of likelihood of experiencing an attack than number of employees.

In fact, encryption just one exception, in every sector, over two thirds of attacks resulted in data levels are now at their highest point in the last four years. This likely reflects the encryption. The highest frequency of data encryption (92%) was reported by ever-increasing skill level of adversaries who continue to innovate and refine their business and professional services. approaches. IT, technology, and telecoms is the sector that bucks the trend, with adversaries succeeding in encrypting data in fewer than half (47%) of attacks.

May 2023 The State of Ransomware 2023 The Impact of Cyber Insurance on Data Recovery Organizations with cyber insurance were considerably more likely to recover encrypted data than those without such policies. However, the type of cyber coverage made very little difference: 98% of those with a standalone policy and 97% of those with a wider insurance policy that covers cyber got data back. In comparison, 84% of those without a policy were able to get encrypted data back.

First, cyber insurance typically requires organizations to have backups and recovery plans as conditions of coverage. Insurers are also able to guide ransomware victims through the recovery process in order to optimize outcomes. Furthermore, organizations with cyber insurance are more likely to pay the ransom to recover data than those without a policy.

May 2023 The State of Ransomware 2023 Ransom Payments While overall propensity to pay ransom remains level with last year’s study, the The study revealed a wide distribution of payments, however the proportion of payments themselves have increased considerably over the last year, with the organizations paying higher ransoms has increased from our 2022 study, with 40% average (mean) ransom payment almost doubling from $812,380 in 2022 to reporting payments of $1 million or more compared to 11% last year. Conversely, just $1,542,333 in 2023. The median ransom payment reported in this year's study 34% paid less than $100,000, down from 54% last year. was $400,000.

May 2023 The State of Ransomware 2023 Ransom Payments by Revenue Perhaps unsurprisingly, the largest revenue organizations were most likely to pay the highest ransoms, reflecting that adversaries will adjust the amount they will accept based on ability to pay. The study did not distinguish between payments funded internally and those funded by insurance providers. Interestingly, there was very little difference in both the mean and median ransom payments for organizations with $250 million - $500 million revenue and those with $500 million - $1 billion revenue. $50-$250 $250-$500 $500 MILLION TO $1 BILLION - $5 $5 BILLION MILLION (N=37) MILLION (N=33) $1 BILLION (N=72) BILLION (N=45) PLUS (N=21) Mean ransom $690,996 $1,523,652 $1,466,240 $2,049,817 $2,464,339 payment Median ransom $145,000 $428,000 $425,000 $1,000,000 $3,000,000 payment How much was the ransom payment that was paid to the attackers?

May 2023 The State of Ransomware 2023 Recovery Costs Ransom payments are just one element of recovery costs when dealing with ransomware events. Excluding any ransoms paid, organizations reported an estimated mean cost to recover from ransomware attacks of $1.82 million, an increase from the 2022 figure of $1.4 million and in line with the $1.85 million reported in 2021. Note: the 2021 and 2022 study question wording included ransom payments in the estimated costs, but they were removed from the 2023 survey wording. As a result, the year-on-year comparison should be considered indicative only.

N.B. 2022 and 2021 question wording also included “ransom payment”. Mean reported recovery costs started at $165,520 for organizations with annual revenue of less than $10 million, rising to $4,496,086 in the $5 billion plus cohort. While these numbers mask a range of recovery costs, there is a clear pattern of recovery costs increasing with revenue, as indicated in the chart on the following page. A Sophos Whitepaper.

The median recovery caused them to lose business/revenue. Annual revenue had a relatively small impact cost for those that used backups ($375,000) is half the cost incurred by those on loss of business, with the lowest rate (79%) reported by the $250 million - $500 that paid the ransom ($750,000).

May 2023 The State of Ransomware 2023 Conclusion Independent of revenue, geography, or industry, ransomware continues to be major threat to organizations. As adversaries continue to hone their attack tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), defenders are struggling to keep pace, resulting in increased encryption rates. The drop in the use of backups to recover encrypted data is considerable cause for concern. If further evidence was needed regarding the financial and operational benefits of investing in a strong backup strategy, this report provides it. With the growth of the ransomware-as-a-service business model, we do not anticipate a drop in attacks in the coming year. Organizations should focus on: Ì Further strengthening their defensive shields with:  Security tools that defend against the most common attack vectors, including endpoint protection with strong anti-exploit capabilities to prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities, and zero trust network access (ZTNA) to thwart the abuse of compromised credentials  Adaptive technologies that respond automatically to attacks, disrupting adversaries and buying defenders time to respond  24/7 threat detection, investigation, and response, whether delivered in-house or in partnership with a specialist Managed Detection and Response (MDR) service provider Ì Optimizing attack preparation, including making regular backups, practicing recovering data from backups, and maintaining an up-to-date incident response plan Ì Maintaining good security hygiene, including timely patching and regularly reviewing security tool configurations A Sophos Whitepaper.
