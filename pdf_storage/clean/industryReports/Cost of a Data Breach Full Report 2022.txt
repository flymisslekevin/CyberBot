Now in its 17th year, this research — conducted independently by Ponemon Institute, and sponsored, analyzed and published by IBM Security® — studied 550 organizations impacted by data breaches that occurred between March 2021 and March 2022. The breaches occurred across 17 countries and regions and in 17 different industries. We conducted more than 3,600 interviews with individuals from organizations that were impacted by the data breaches. During the interviews, we asked questions to determine the cost to organizations across different activities related directly to both the immediate and prolonged response to the data breaches. As in previous years’ reports, this year’s data provides a view of how dozens of factors impact the costs that keep adding up after a data breach occurs. Additionally, the report examines root causes, short-term and long-term consequences of data breaches, and the mitigating factors and technologies that allowed companies to limit losses. 3 What’s new in the 2022 report Significantly, for the first time, the research shows the following insights: With each year’s edition, we aim to build upon past research to keep up with changing technology and events. We also try to form a more relevant picture of the risks and strategies 83% for securing data and responding to a breach, from artificial intelligence (AI) to zero trust. Covering some of the technologies most companies focused on in the past year, the 2022 edition of of organizations studied have had more this report has new analysis related to the value of the following: than one data breach. – Extended detection and response (XDR) – The use of risk quantification techniques – Impacts of individual technologies that contribute to a zero trust security framework, such as identity and access 60% management (IAM) and multifactor authentication (MFA) Furthermore, the report takes a broader look at some leading of organizations’ breaches led to increases contributors to higher data breach costs. For the first time, the in prices passed on to customers. report looks at the effects of supply chain compromises and the security skills gap. The report examines areas of security vulnerability from the 79% cloud to critical infrastructure. And we take a deeper dive than past years into the impacts of ransomware and destructive attacks. Also studied is the phenomenon of remote work that of critical infrastructure organizations didn’t continues to be a reality for many organizations past the peak deploy a zero trust architecture. of the COVID pandemic. As companies experience more breaches and costs continue to climb, this report can serve as a tool to help your teams 19% better manage risk and limit potential losses. The report is divided into the following five major sections: – The executive summary with key findings and what’s of breaches occurred because of a new in the 2022 edition compromise at a business partner. – In-depth analysis on the complete findings, including breach costs by geographic region and industry – Security recommendations from IBM Security experts based on this report’s results 45% – Demographics of organizations and industry definitions – The study’s methodology, including how costs were calculated of the breaches were cloud-based. IBM Security and Ponemon Institute are pleased to present the results of the 2022 Cost of a Data Breach Report. 4 Key findings The key findings described here are based on IBM Security analysis of research data compiled by Ponemon Institute.1 USD 4.35 million Reaching an all-time high, the cost of a data breach averaged USD 4.35 million in 2022. This figure represents a 2.6% increase from last year, when the average cost of a breach was Average total cost of a data breach USD 4.24 million. The average cost has climbed 12.7% from USD 3.86 million in the 2020 report. 83% Eighty-three percent of organizations studied have experienced more than one data breach, and just 17% said this was their first data breach. Sixty percent of organizations studied stated Percentage of organizations that have that they increased the price of their services or products had more than one breach because of the data breach. USD 4.82 million The average cost of a data breach for critical infrastructure organizations studied was USD 4.82 million — USD 1 million more than the average cost for organizations in other industries. Average cost of a critical infrastructure Critical infrastructure organizations included those in the data breach financial services, industrial, technology, energy, transportation, communication, healthcare, education and public sector industries. Twenty-eight percent experienced a destructive or ransomware attack, while 17% experienced a breach because of a business partner being compromised. USD 3.05 million Breaches at organizations with fully deployed security AI and automation cost USD 3.05 million less than breaches at organizations with no security AI and automation deployed. This Average cost savings associated with fully 65.2% difference in average breach cost — between USD 3.15 deployed security AI and automation million for fully deployed versus USD 6.20 million for not deployed — represented the largest cost savings in the study. Companies with fully deployed security AI and automation also experienced on average a 74-day shorter time to identify and contain the breach, known as the breach lifecycle, than those without security AI and automation — 249 days versus 323 days. The use of security AI and automation jumped by nearly one-fifth in two years, from 59% in 2020 to 70% in 2022. 1. Cost amounts in this report are measured in US dollars (USD). 5 USD 4.54 million Eleven percent of breaches in the study were ransomware attacks, an increase from 2021, when 7.8% of breaches were ransomware, for a growth rate of 41%. The average cost of a ransomware Average cost of a ransomware attack, not attack went down slightly, from USD 4.62 million in 2021 to including the cost of the ransom itself USD 4.54 million in 2022. This cost was slightly higher than the overall average total cost of a data breach, USD 4.35 million. 19% Use of stolen or compromised credentials remains the most common cause of a data breach. Stolen or compromised credentials were the primary attack vector in 19% of breaches in Frequency of breaches caused by stolen the 2022 study and also the top attack vector in the 2021 study, or compromised credentials having caused 20% of breaches. Breaches caused by stolen or compromised credentials had an average cost of USD 4.50 million. These breaches had the longest lifecycle — 243 days to identify the breach, and another 84 days to contain the breach. Phishing was the second most common cause of a breach at 16% and also the costliest, averaging USD 4.91 million in breach costs. 59% Just 41% of organizations in the study said they deploy a zero trust security architecture. The other 59% percent of organizations that don’t deploy zero trust incur an average of Percentage of organizations that don’t USD 1 million in greater breach costs compared to those that deploy zero trust do deploy. Among critical infrastructure organizations, an even higher percentage of 79% doesn’t deploy zero trust. These organizations experienced on average USD 5.40 million in breach costs, more than USD 1 million higher than the global average. USD 1 million When remote working was a factor in causing the breach, costs were an average of nearly USD 1 million greater than in breaches where remote working wasn’t a factor — USD 4.99 million versus Average difference in cost where remote USD 4.02 million. Remote work-related breaches cost on average work was a factor in causing the breach about USD 600,000 more compared to the global average. versus when it wasn’t a factor 45% Forty-five percent of breaches in the study occurred in the cloud. Yet breaches that happened in a hybrid cloud environment cost an average of USD 3.80 million, compared to USD 4.24 million Share of breaches that occurred in the cloud for breaches in private clouds and USD 5.02 million for breaches in public clouds. The cost difference was 27.6% between hybrid cloud breaches and public cloud breaches. Organizations with a hybrid cloud model also had shorter breach lifecycles than organizations that solely adopted a public or private cloud model. 6 USD 2.66 million Nearly three-quarters of organizations in the study said they had an IR plan, while 63% of those organizations said they regularly tested the plan. Having an IR team and an IR plan that was Average cost savings associated with an regularly tested led to significant cost savings. Businesses with incident response (IR) team and regularly an IR team that tested its IR plan saw an average of USD 2.66 tested IR plan million lower breach costs than organizations without an IR team and that don’t test an IR plan. The difference of USD 3.26 million versus USD 5.92 million represents a 58% cost savings. 29 days XDR technologies were implemented by 44% of organizations. Those organizations with XDR technologies saw considerable advantages in response times. Those organizations with XDR Savings in response time for those deployed shortened the breach lifecycle by about a month, with extended detection and response on average, compared to organizations that didn’t implement (XDR) technologies XDR. Specifically, organizations took 275 days to identify and contain a breach with XDR deployed versus 304 days without XDR deployed. This figure represents a 10% difference in response times. 12 years Healthcare breach costs hit a new record high. The average breach in healthcare increased by nearly USD 1 million to reach USD 10.10 million. Healthcare breach costs have been the most Consecutive years the healthcare industry expensive industry for 12 years running, increasing by 41.6% had the highest average cost of a breach since the 2020 report. Financial organizations had the second highest costs — averaging USD 5.97 million — followed by pharmaceuticals at USD 5.01 million, technology at USD 4.97 million and energy at USD 4.72 million. USD 9.44 million The top five countries and regions for the highest average cost of a data breach were the United States at USD 9.44 million, the Middle East at USD 7.46 million, Canada at USD 5.64 million, the Average cost of a breach in the United States, United Kingdom at USD 5.05 million and Germany at USD 4.85 the highest of any country million. The United States has led the list for 12 years in a row. Meanwhile, the country with the fastest growth rate over last year was Brazil, a 27.8% increase from USD 1.08 million to USD 1.38 million. 7 Complete findings In this section, we provide the detailed findings of this report, in 16 themes. Topics are presented in the following order: – Global highlights – Data breach lifecycle – Initial attack vectors – Key cost factors – Security AI and automation – XDR technologies – Incident response – Risk quantification – Zero trust – Ransomware and destructive attacks – Supply chain attacks – Critical infrastructure – Cloud breaches and cloud model – Remote work – Skills gap – Mega breaches 8 USD 4.35 million Global highlights The Cost of a Data Breach Report is a global report, comprising Global average total cost of a data breach data from 17 countries and regions and 17 industries. In this section, we look at several key metrics at the level of global average, as well as comparative costs between countries and between industries. Figure 1: The average cost of a data breach reached a record high in 2022. The global average total cost of a data breach increased by USD 0.11 million to USD 4.35 million in 2022, the highest it’s been in the history of this report. The increase from USD 4.24 million in the 2021 report to USD 4.35 million in the 2022 report represents a 2.6% increase. In the last two years, the average total cost has increased 12.7% from USD 3.86 million in the 2020 report. Average total cost of a data breach Figure 2: The per record cost of a data breach hit a seven-year high. $4.50 $4.35 The global per record cost of a data breach in 2022 was $4.30 $4.24 USD 164, a 1.9% increase from USD 161 in 2021. The increase $4.10 $4.00 from USD 146 in 2020 is an increase of 12.3%.

The United Kingdom climbed to number four from 5. Germany — USD 4.85 million eighth out of the 17 countries or regions, surpassing Germany, Japan and France in the ranking. The average total cost of a breach in the United Kingdom was USD 5.05 million, up from USD 4.67 million, an increase of USD 0.38 million, or 8.1%. Out of the 17 countries or regions studied, six — Germany, Japan, France, South Korea, Scandinavia and Turkey — saw a decrease in the average total cost of a data breach. Brazil, 16th on the list at USD 1.38 million, saw the largest relative cost increase, up USD 0.3 million or 27.8%. Turkey, 17th on the list, saw the largest relative cost decrease, falling from USD 1.91 million to USD 1.11 million, a decrease of USD 0.8 million or 42%. Broad swings in currency valuations, such as occurred in Turkey, can play a role in cost variations from year to year. 1100 Average cost of a data breach by industry $10.10 Healthcare $9.23 $5.97 Financial $5.72 $5.01 Pharmaceuticals $5.04 Technology $4.97 $4.88 Energy $4.72 $4.65 Services $4.70 $4.65 Industrial $4.47 $4.24 Research $3.88 $3.60 Consumer $3.86 $3.70 Education $3.86 $3.79 Entertainment $3.83 $3.80 Communications $3.62 $3.62 Transportation $3.59 $3.75 Retail $3.28 $3.27 Media $3.15 $3.17 Hospitality $2.94 $3.03 Public sector $2.07 $1.93 $0.00 $2.00 $4.00 $6.00 $8.00 $10.00 2022 2021 Figure 4: Measured in USD millions Figure 4: Healthcare was highest cost industry for the 12th year in a row.

The industrial industry, comprised of chemical, engineering and manufacturing organizations, saw an increase from USD 4.24 million to USD 4.47 million in 2022, an increase of USD 0.23 million or 5.4%. The average total cost decreased slightly in four industries — pharmaceuticals, transportation, media and hospitality. 11 Figure 5: Detection and escalation costs surpassed lost business costs as the largest of four cost categories comprising the cost of a data breach, for the first time in six years. Broken down into four cost categories — lost business, detection and escalation, notification and post breach response — the largest share of data breach costs in 2022 was detection and escalation. Detection and escalation costs increased from USD 1.24 million in 2021 to USD 1.44 million in 2022, an increase of USD 0.2 million or 16.1%. Detection and escalation costs include activities that enable a company to reasonably detect a breach. These costs include forensic and investigative activities; assessment and audit services; crisis management; and communications to executives and boards. For the first time in at least six years, lost business, at USD 1.42 million in 2022, wasn’t the largest share of data breach costs. Lost business costs decreased from USD 1.59 million in 2021, a decrease of 10.7%. Lost business costs include activities that attempt to minimize the loss of customers, business disruption and revenue losses. These costs include business disruption and revenue losses from system downtime; cost of lost customers and acquiring new customers; and reputation losses and diminished goodwill. Notification costs and post breach response costs remained relatively unchanged from 2021 to 2022. See “How we calculate the cost of a data breach” in the “Research methodology” section for definitions of each of the four cost categories.

Eighty-three percent said this wasn’t their first data breach. With security teams handling more incidents every year and considering the impact of remote work on security, it’s likely the recurrence of breaches is climbing. Figure 7: A majority of organizations in the study said they increased the price of their products and services as a result of the data breach. In response to the question, 60% said they increased prices, Yes and 40% said they didn’t increase prices. 60% No 40% Figure 7 13 277 days Data breach lifecycle The time elapsed between the first detection of the breach Average time to identify and contain and its containment is referred to as the data breach lifecycle. a data breach The time to identify a breach describes the time it takes to detect that an incident has occurred. The time to contain a breach refers to the time it takes for an organization to resolve a situation when it’s been detected and ultimately restore service. These metrics can be used to determine the effectiveness of an organization’s incident response and containment processes. Figure 8: The mean or average time to identify and contain a data breach fell from 287 days in 2021 to 277 days in 2022, a decrease of 10 days or 3.5%. In 2022 it took an average of 207 days to identify the breach and 70 days to contain the breach. In 2021 it took an average of 212 days to identify the breach and 75 days to contain the breach. The 277-day average in 2022 means that if a breach occurred on January 1, it would take until October 4 of that year to identify and contain the breach. The 277-day average is consistent with the average over the past seven years, with a maximum difference of 11% between the lowest total, 257 days in 2017, and the highest total, 287 days in 2021.

A data breach lifecycle of less than 200 days was associated with an average cost of USD 3.74 million in 2022, compared to USD 4.86 million for breaches with a lifecycle of greater than 200 days. This difference represents an average cost savings of USD 1.12 million, or 26.5%, for breaches with the shorter than 200-day lifecycle. The cost gap between a lifecycle longer than 200 days and a lifecycle shorter than 200 days was smaller in 2022 than in 2021, when it was USD 1.26 million. The cost gap in 2022 — USD 1.12 million — is the same size as the cost gap in 2020. The cost gap has grown slightly over the past seven years, while the average cost of a data breach has also grown incrementally. The 2021 cost gap of USD 1.26 million was the largest of the past seven years. Average cost of a data breach based on data breach lifecycle $6.00 $5.00 $4.87 $4.86 $4.56 $4.33 $4.15 $4.00 $3.75 $3.74 $3.61 $3.61 $3.34 $3.21 $3.21 $3.00 $2.79 $2.54 $2.00 $1.00 $0.00 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Lifecycle < 200 days Lifecycle > 200 days Figure 9: Measured in USD millions.

The difference between low and high regulatory environments showed up in a pronounced way two years or more after the data breach — the “longtail” costs. In highly regulated industries, an average of 24% of data breach costs were accrued more than two years after the breach occurred. This result compares to an average of 8% of costs accrued more than two years after a breach in low regulatory environments. In low regulatory environments, data breach costs tended to Time elapsed Percentage of total cost accrue in the first three to six months — where an average of 2022 average Low High 24% of data breach costs accrued.

The breaches in the study are divided initial attack vector into 10 initial attack vectors, ranging from accidental data loss and cloud misconfiguration to phishing, insider threats and stolen or compromised credentials. This section also compares the average time it takes to identify and contain breaches based on their initial attack vector. Figure 11: The most common initial attack vector in 2022 was stolen or compromised credentials, responsible for 19% of breaches in the study, at an average cost of USD 4.50 million. In 2022, the most common initial attack vectors were compromised credentials at 19% of breaches, phishing at 16% of breaches, cloud misconfiguration at 15% of breaches and vulnerability in third-party software at 13% of breaches. The 2021 report saw the same order of the top four initial attack vectors. The costliest initial attack vector in 2022 on average was phishing at USD 4.91 million. Following phishing was business email compromise at USD 4.89 million and 6% of breaches, vulnerability in third-party software at USD 4.55 million and compromised credentials at USD 4.50 million.

Stolen or compromised credentials were the initial attack vector with the longest mean time to identify and contain the breach, at 327 days. That time is 16.6% greater than the overall mean time to identify and contain a data breach. Compromised credentials were also the most common — 19% — initial attack vector leading to data breaches in the study. Breaches caused by business email compromise had the second highest mean time to identify and contain, at 308 days. Business email compromise was also the second costliest initial attack vector, with breaches costing an average of USD 4.89 million. Breaches caused by phishing had the third highest mean time to identify and contain, at 295 days, and had the highest average cost by initial attack vector, at USD 4.91 million.

A special analysis of 28 cost factors examines their impact on the mean cost of a data breach. We look at how these 28 factors were associated with either lower- than-average breach costs stemming from a cost mitigating influence, or a higher-than-average cost of a breach resulting from a cost amplifying influence. The following cost factors are new to the report this year: IAM; XDR technologies; MFA; and crisis management teams. These cost factors aren’t additive, so it’s not consistent with this research to add multiple cost factors together to calculate the cost of a breach. 19 Figure 13 shows the impact of 28 factors on the average On the other hand, security system complexity, occurrence cost of a data breach. of cloud migration when the organization is in the process of The chart shows the average cost difference of breaches at migrating to the cloud and compliance failures were the three organizations with these cost-influencing factors compared to factors associated with the highest net increase in the average the mean cost of a data breach of USD 4.35 million.

For example, breaches at organizations with security divided into those factors that are associated with a lower- system complexity had an average cost of USD 290,655 more than-average breach cost, which are cost mitigators, and those than the mean cost of a data breach of USD 4.35 million — factors that are associated with a higher-than-average breach which is approximately USD 4.64 million. cost, or cost amplifiers. For the first time, this year’s report measured the impact of AI platforms, a DevSecOps approach and use of an incident the following four new cost factors: IAM; XDR technologies; response (IR) team were the three factors associated with the MFA; and crisis management teams. Each of these factors was highest cost decrease compared to the mean cost of a breach. associated with lower-than-average breach costs, led by IAM. For example, breaches at organizations with AI platforms had an average cost that was USD 300,075 less than the mean cost of a data breach of USD 4.35 million — which is approximately USD 4.05 million.

This chart compares organizations with a high level of the cost factor to those with a low level of the cost factor. There was a difference of USD 2.47 million, or 58%, between high levels and low levels of security system complexity. A difference of USD 2.27 million, or 50.5%, occurred between high levels and low levels of cloud migration. There was a difference of USD 2.26 million, or 50.9%, between high levels and low levels of compliance failures. These data points showed that having high levels of these cost factors present was also associated with a significantly higher than average cost of a data breach. Organizations with a high level of cloud migration had a USD 5.63 million average cost that was USD 1.28 million higher than the average cost of a data breach, a difference of 25.7%.

In this security AI and automation versus no context, security AI and automation refers to enabling security security AI and automation technologies that augment or replace human intervention in the identification and containment of incidents and intrusion attempts. Such technologies depend upon AI, machine learning, analytics and automated security orchestration. On the opposite end of the spectrum are processes driven by manual inputs, often across dozens of tools and complex, nonintegrated systems, without data shared between them. Figure 16: The share of organizations with fully or partially deployed security AI and automation increased by five percentage points, from 65% to 70%, between 2021 and 2022. Fully deployed security AI and automation increased by six percentage points, from 25% to 31%, between 2021 and 2022 and by 10 percentage points, from 21% to 31%, between 2020 and 2022. The share of organizations with no security AI and automation deployed decreased from 35% in 2021 to 30% in 2022 and has decreased from 41% in 2020, a difference of 11 percentage points.

Organizations with fully deployed security AI and automation had an average total cost of a data breach of USD 3.15 million. This average total cost compared to USD 6.20 million for organizations without security AI and automation deployed. The difference between average cost of a breach with fully deployed security automation and no security AI and automation deployed was smaller in 2022 than in 2021, when the gap was USD 3.81 million, or in 2020, when the savings was USD 3.58 million.

Organizations with fully deployed security AI and automation took an average of 181 days to identify and 68 days to contain the data breach, for a total lifecycle of 249 days. Those organizations with no security AI and automation deployed took an average 235 days to identify and 88 days to contain a breach, for a total lifecycle of 323 days, which was 74 days longer than organizations with fully deployed security AI and automation. The average time to identify and contain a breach was a total of 299 days with partially deployed security AI and automation. 2244 29 days XDR technologies For the first time, the study examined the effects of XDR Organizations with XDR technologies identified technologies on the cost of a data breach. This section looks and contained a breach 29 days faster than at the prevalence of XDR in the organizations studied, those without XDR plus its impact on average total cost and the average time to contain data breaches. Significantly, XDR impacted average breach costs with a savings of 9.2%. While these savings may appear humble at first sight, the true impact comes in the amount of time organizations saved in breach duration when they use XDR — nearly one month. Extra time to identify and contain a breach can add a lot to the overall cost of a breach and its consequences. Figure 19: XDR capabilities were commonly used Is your organization implementing XDR technologies? but not yet by a majority of organizations. According to the survey of 550 organizations in the study, 44% are implementing XDR technologies, while 56% aren’t implementing XDR technologies. Yes 44% No 56% Figure 19 25 Figure 20: The use of XDR technologies was associated with a lower-than-average cost of a data breach. Those organizations that are implementing XDR technologies experienced an average cost of a data breach of USD 4.15 million. Organizations that weren’t implementing XDR technologies experienced an average cost of a data breach of USD 4.55 million. This cost was above the global average and USD 0.40 million more than breaches at organizations implementing XDR technologies, a difference of 9.2%.

In this year’s analysis, we versus those with no IR team and had not again looked at how IR teams, capabilities and processes tested an IR plan impacted the cost of a breach. Figure 22: A majority of organizations in the study had IR plans and testing of IR plans on a regular basis. Nearly three-quarters of organizations in the study said they had an IR plan, with 73% saying they did have an IR plan and 27% saying they didn’t have a plan. At organizations with an IR plan, 63% said they regularly tested the IR plan, with 37% saying they didn’t regularly test the IR plan.

The gap between the average data breach cost at organizations with both IR teams and IR plan testing and those with neither IR teams or IR plan testing continued to grow between the 2020 report and the 2022 report. Breaches at organizations with IR capabilities saw an average cost of a breach of USD 3.26 million in 2022, compared to USD 5.92 million at organizations without IR capabilities. This average cost was a difference of USD 2.66 million, or 58%. Those savings were an increase over 2021, when the average cost of a breach at organizations with IR capabilities saved USD 2.46 million, and in 2020, when the cost difference was USD 1.77 million. This finding indicates a growing cost-saving effectiveness of IR capabilities. 28 USD 2.10 million Risk quantification Risk quantification looks at impacts, including financial impacts, Cost savings of breaches at organizations availability of data and data integrity. Using risk quantification that use risk quantification techniques can highlight financial loss types by impact, including the versus those that don’t following examples: loss of productivity; cost of response or recovery; reputation impact; and fines and judgments. Chief information security officers (CISOs), risk managers and security teams can use benchmark research like the Cost of a Data Breach Report to infer general trends and cost averages in their industry or geography. However, using data specific to the organization, rather than industry averages, can clarify potential security gaps and how to reduce overall risk by quantifying security risk into financial terms. This section looks at how many organizations are using risk quantification techniques to prioritize risks, threats and impacts and reviews the average cost impact of risk quantification techniques. Figure 24: Less than half, 47%, said they prioritize risks, Does your organization prioritize risks, threats and threats and impacts based on risk quantification techniques. impacts based on risk quantification techniques? Meanwhile, out of the 550 organizations studied, 53% don’t prioritize risks, threats and impacts based on risk quantification techniques. Figure 25: Risk quantification had a considerable effect on data breach costs, saving up to USD 2.10 million on average. Yes 47% Organizations that prioritized risks, threats and impacts based on risk quantification techniques had an average breach cost of USD 3.30 million. That cost was USD 2.10 million less than those that didn’t use risk quantification, at USD 5.40 million, a savings of 48.3%.

The zero trust approach operates on early adoption of zero trust the assumption that user identities or the network itself may already be compromised, and instead relies on AI and analytics to continuously validate connections between users, data and resources. As the data in this section shows, zero trust has a net positive impact on data breach costs. Figure 26: In the 2022 study, 41% of organizations Has your organization deployed a zero trust said they have deployed a zero trust security architecture, security architecture? while 59% said they haven’t. This finding compares to the 2021 report when 35% said they had partially or fully deployed a zero trust architecture. Yes 41% No 59% Figure 26 30 Figure 27: Organizations with zero trust deployed saved nearly USD 1 million in average breach costs compared to organizations without zero trust deployed. The average cost of a data breach was USD 4.15 million at organizations with zero trust deployed, while the cost of a breach was an average USD 5.10 million at organizations without zero trust deployed. The difference was USD 0.95 million, representing a 20.5% savings for organizations with zero trust deployed. Figure 28: Having a mature zero trust deployment was associated with breach costs that were more than USD 1.5 million lower than breaches at organizations with early adoption of zero trust. Organizations with mature stage deployment of their zero trust security architecture, when zero trust is applied consistently across all domains, had an average data breach cost of USD 3.45 million. In midstage, when zero trust was applied in many Impact of zero trust on average cost of a data breach areas of the organization, the average cost of a data breach was USD 3.96 million. For early adoption stage organizations $6.00 that were beginning to implement a few practices, the average $5.10 cost of a data breach was USD 4.96 million.

Based on classification by the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), critical infrastructure industries in this study included financial services, industrial, technology, energy, transportation, communication, healthcare, education and public sector. One revelation of this analysis was that critical infrastructure industries had a much lower prevalence of zero trust security approaches than the global average. Critical infrastructure industries without zero trust strategies deployed had significantly higher data breach costs than average. Figure 36: Ransomware and destructive attacks were Types of critical infrastructure breaches responsible for more than a quarter of breaches in critical infrastructure industries. Ransomware attacks accounted for 12% of critical infrastructure breaches, while destructive attacks were behind 16% of critical infrastructure breaches, for a combined 28%. Another 17% of breaches on these industries were supply chain attacks where a 8% 12% third-party business partner was the attack vector. Meanwhile, breaches caused by human error or IT failures accounted for 22% and 25%, respectively. The remaining 8% of critical infrastructure breaches were other malicious attacks. 16% 25% 17% 22% Ransomware attack Destructive attack Supply chain attack Human error IT failure Other malicious attack Figure 36 36 Figure 37: The average cost of a data breach in critical infrastructure organizations was USD 4.82 million. Critical infrastructure organizations had an average cost of a data breach USD 0.99 million higher than USD 3.83 million for organizations in noncritical infrastructure industries, a difference of 22.9%. Noncritical infrastructure industries included those organizations in pharmaceuticals, services, entertainment, consumer goods, media, hospitality, retail and research. Figure 38: Critical infrastructure industries identified and contained data breaches more quickly than other industries. The lifecycle of a data breach in critical infrastructure industries took fewer days than the global average or noncritical infrastructure industries. The mean time to identify in critical infrastructure industries was 204 days, compared to 211 days for other industries. The mean time to contain for critical infrastructure industries was 69 days, compared to 71 days for Average cost of a data breach for critical infrastructure other industries.

The research found that 45% of breaches to safeguard their cloud environments occurred in the cloud, but those in the public cloud cost considerably more than breaches at organizations with a hybrid cloud model. However, analysis of the research also shows that organizations still need a mature cloud security posture, regardless of cloud model. Figure 41: A plurality of study participants had a hybrid cloud IT operating model, with 45% indicating they had a hybrid cloud model. Meanwhile, 28% said their IT model was fully on-premises, and 27% said their IT model was completely cloud-based. Figure 42: Nearly half of organizations experienced a data breach in the cloud. Forty-five percent said the data breach occurred in the cloud, whereas 55% said the data breach didn’t occur in the cloud. What best describes your IT operating model?

Another 26% of organizations said that they were in the early stage, meaning that they had begun applying a few cloud security practices. Finally, 17% of organizations said that they had not started their journey in securing their cloud environments. 40 Figure 44: Organizations with mature cloud security had a Average cost of a data breach by cloud security lower-than-average cost of a data breach. maturity level At mature organizations, breach costs were on average USD 0.66 million less than organizations in the early stages of $5.00 $4.53 $4.59 securing their cloud environments.

In the context of the pandemic, was a factor in causing the breach were starting with last year’s report, we’ve examined the impacts of about USD 1 million more than breaches work-from-home arrangements on data breach costs. Remote where remote work wasn’t a factor working has had considerable effects on the cost of a breach when remote work was a factor in causing the breach, such as a remote-working employee having credentials stolen. The study also found that breach costs were highest for organizations with most of their employees working remotely. Figure 49: There was a strong correlation between remote working and cost of a data breach, where more employees working remotely was associated with higher data breach costs. For those organizations with the largest share of employees Average cost of a data breach based on share of working remotely — 81% to 100% — the average cost of a data employees working remotely breach was USD 5.10 million. That cost was a slight decrease in this category from last year. For organizations with the smallest $6.00 $5.54 share of employees working remotely — less than 20% — the $5.10 $4.89 average cost was USD 3.99 million. The difference between $5.00 $4.28 $4.39 highest and lowest share of employees working remotely was $3.93$3.99 $4.02$4.04 USD 1.11 million, a difference of 24.4%. $4.00 $3.15 $3.00 Figure 50: The average total cost of a data breach was nearly USD 1 million greater when remote work was a factor $2.00 in causing the data breach. Organizations that indicated remote work was a factor in the $1.00 breach experienced an average cost of a data breach of USD 4.99 million.

Those organizations that said they were sufficiently sufficiently staffed organization versus staffed saw considerable cost savings in terms of data breach insufficiently staffed costs, compared to those without enough employees to staff their teams. This was the first year of this report that we took a deeper look at the security skills gap. Figure 51: There was a widespread security skills shortage among organizations in the study. Is your security team sufficiently staffed? Only a little more than one-third of organizations had sufficiently staffed security teams. Just 38% of organizations said their security teams were sufficiently staffed to meet their security management needs, while 62% said they weren’t sufficiently staffed. Yes 38% Figure 52: Organizations that said their security teams had a skills shortage had a higher-than-average cost of the data breach. At organizations with a sufficiently staffed security team, the average cost of a data breach was lower than average. The average cost of a data breach at sufficiently staffed organizations was USD 4.01 million. In contrast, the average cost of a data breach was USD 4.56 million at organizations with insufficiently staffed security teams, a difference of USD 0.55 million, or 12.8%.

This study included 13 companies that experienced a data breach involving the loss or theft of 1 million to 60 million records. The study of the mega breaches involved a distinct methodology from the other 550 breaches in this study, each of which had no more than 102,000 lost records. For a full explanation of the research methodology, see the “Data breach FAQ” at the end of this report.

Mega breach costs saw a decrease from 2021 in six of seven breach size cohorts. The cost of the largest mega breaches of 50 million to 60 million records decreased from USD 401 million in 2021 to USD 387 million, a drop of USD 14 million or 3.6%. The cohort for 20 million to 30 million records was the only cohort where the average increased from last year. In that cohort, the average total cost of a mega breach increased from USD 230 million to USD 241 million, an increase of USD 11 million or 4.8%. 46 Recommendations to help minimize financial impacts of a data breach In this section, IBM Security outlines steps organizations can take to help reduce the financial cost and reputational consequences of a data breach. These recommendations include successful security approaches taken by organizations in the study. Adopt a zero trust security model to help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Results from the study showed that while just 41% of organizations had implemented a zero trust security approach, they had a potential breach cost saving of USD 1.5 million with a mature deployment. As organizations incorporate remote work and hybrid multicloud environments, a zero trust strategy can help protect data and resources by limiting their accessibility and requiring context. Security tools that can share data between disparate systems and centralize data security operations can help security teams detect incidents across complex hybrid multicloud environments. You can gain deeper insights, mitigate risks and accelerate response with an open security platform that can advance your zero trust strategy. At the same time, you can use your existing investments while leaving your data where it is, helping your team become more efficient and collaborative. 47 Protect sensitive data in cloud environments using policy Create and test incident response playbooks to increase and encryption. cyber resilience. With the increasing amount and value of data being hosted in Two of the most effective ways to mitigate the cost of a data cloud environments, organizations should take steps to protect breach are forming an incident response (IR) team and extensive cloud-hosted databases. Mature cloud security practices were testing of the IR plan. Breaches at organizations with IR teams associated with breach cost savings of USD 720,000 compared that regularly test their plan saw USD 2.66 million in savings to no cloud security practices. Use data classification schema compared to breaches at organizations with no IR team or and retention programs to help bring visibility into and reduce testing of the IR plan.

Use tools that help protect and monitor endpoints and remote employees. In the study, breaches where remote work was a factor in causing the breach cost nearly USD 1 million more than breaches where remote work wasn’t a factor. Unified endpoint management (UEM), endpoint detection and response (EDR) and identity and access management (IAM) products and services can help provide security teams with deeper visibility into suspicious activity. This oversight involves bring your own devices (BYOD) and company laptops, desktops, tablets, mobile devices and IoT, including endpoints the organization doesn’t have physical access to. UEM, EDR and IAM speed investigation and response time to isolate and contain the damage in breaches where remote work was a factor. 48 Organization demographics This year’s study comprised 550 organizations of various sizes, geographies and industries.

Data collection methods excluded actual accounting information and instead relied upon participants estimating direct costs by marking a range variable on a number line. Participants were instructed to mark the number line in one spot between the lower and upper limits of a range for each cost category. The numerical value obtained from the number line, rather than a point estimate for each presented cost category, preserved confidentiality and ensured a higher response rate. The benchmark instrument also required respondents to provide a second estimate for indirect and opportunity costs, separately. To ensure a manageable size for benchmarking, we carefully limited items to only cost activity centers that we considered crucial to measuring data breach costs. Based on discussions with experts, the final set of items included a fixed set of cost activities. After collecting benchmark information, we re-examined each instrument carefully for consistency and completeness. We limited the scope of data breach cost items to known cost categories that applied to a broad set of business operations that handle personal information. Our belief was that a study focused on business process — not data protection or privacy compliance activities — would yield better quality results. 53 How we calculate the cost of a data breach To calculate the average cost of a data breach, this research excluded very small and very large breaches. Data breaches examined in the 2022 study ranged in size between 2,200 and 102,000 compromised records. We used a separate analysis to examine the costs of very large mega breaches, which is explained further in the “Data breach FAQ” section of the report. This research used activity-based This research used activity-based costing, which identifies activities and assigns a cost according to actual use. Four costing, which identifies activities process-related activities drive a range of expenditures and assigns a cost according to associated with an organization’s data breach: detection and actual use. escalation, notification, post breach response and lost business. Detection and escalation Activities that enable a company to reasonably detect the breach, including the following: – Forensic and investigative activities – Assessment and audit services – Crisis management – Communications to executives and boards Notification Activities that enable the company to notify data subjects, data protection regulators and other third parties, including the following: – Emails, letters, outbound calls or general notice to data subjects – Determination of regulatory requirements – Communication with regulators – Engagement of outside experts Post breach response Activities to help victims of a breach communicate with the company and redress activities to victims and regulators, including the following: – Help desk and inbound communications – Credit monitoring and identity protection services – Issuing new accounts or credit cards – Legal expenditures – Product discounts – Regulatory fines Lost business Activities that attempt to minimize the loss of customers, business disruption and revenue losses, including the following: – Business disruption and revenue losses from system downtime – Cost of losing customers and acquiring new customers – Reputation losses and diminished goodwill 54 Data breach FAQ Can the average per record cost be used to calculate the cost of breaches involving millions of lost or stolen records? What is a data breach? The average cost of data breaches in our research doesn’t apply A breach is defined as an event in which an individual’s name to catastrophic or mega data breaches, such as Equifax, Capital and a medical record, a financial record or both, or debit card One or Facebook. These events aren’t typical of the breaches are potentially put at risk. These records can be in electronic or many organizations experience. To draw useful conclusions in paper format. Breaches included in the study ranged from 2,200 understanding data breach cost behaviors, we targeted data to 102,000 compromised records. breach incidents that didn’t exceed 102,000 records. What is a compromised record? It’s not consistent with this research to use the per record cost A record is information that identifies the natural person or to calculate the cost of single or multiple breaches totaling individual whose information has been lost or stolen in a data millions of records. However, the study uses a simulation breach. Examples include a database with an individual’s framework for measuring the cost impact of a mega breach name, credit card information and other personally identifiable involving 1 million or more records, based on a sample of 13 very information (PII) or a health record with the policyholder’s name large breaches of this size. and payment information.

Since starting this research in 2005, we have studied the data breach experiences of 5,027 organizations. This research represented only events directly relevant to the data breach experience. Regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) may encourage organizations to increase investments in their cybersecurity governance technologies. However, such activities didn’t directly affect the cost of a data breach for this research. For consistency with prior years, we used the same currency translation method rather than adjusting accounting costs. How does benchmark research differ from survey research? The unit of analysis in the Cost of a Data Breach Report was the organization. In survey research, the unit of analysis is the individual. We recruited 550 organizations to participate in this study. 55 Research limitations Our study used a confidential and proprietary benchmark method that has been successfully deployed in earlier research. However, the inherent limitations with this benchmark research need to be carefully considered before drawing conclusions from findings. The benchmark didn’t capture any Non-statistical results Our study drew upon a representative, non-statistical sample company-identifying information. of global entities. Statistical inferences, margins of error and confidence intervals can’t be applied to these data, given that our sampling methods weren’t scientific. Non-response Non-response bias wasn’t tested, so it’s possible that companies that didn’t participate are substantially different in terms of underlying data breach cost. Sampling-frame bias Because our sampling frame was judgmental, the quality of results was influenced by the degree to which the frame was representative of the population of companies being studied. We believe that the current sampling frame was biased toward companies with more mature privacy or information security programs. Company-specific information The benchmark didn’t capture company-identifying information. Individuals could use categorical response variables to disclose demographic information about the company and industry category. Unmeasured factors We omitted variables from our analyses such as leading trends and organizational characteristics. The extent to which omitted variables might explain benchmark results can’t be determined. Extrapolated cost results While certain checks and balances can be incorporated into the benchmark process, it’s always possible that respondents didn’t provide accurate or truthful responses. In addition, the use of cost extrapolation methods rather than actual cost data may inadvertently introduce bias and inaccuracies. Currency conversions The conversion from local currencies to the US dollar deflated average total cost estimates in other countries. For purposes of consistency with prior years, we decided to continue to use the same accounting method rather than adjust the cost. 56 About Ponemon Institute and IBM Security Ponemon Institute Ponemon Institute is dedicated to independent research and education that advances responsible information and privacy management practices within business and government.
