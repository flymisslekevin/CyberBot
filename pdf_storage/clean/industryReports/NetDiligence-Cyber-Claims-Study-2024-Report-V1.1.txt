While we’ve seen a significant increase in incident costs for business email compromise claims, there’s also been a reduction in losses related to general “hacker” incidents. Some additional positive trends noted include: wire fraud costs have steadily declined since 2020; healthcare SMEs appear to have continued to benefit from decreasing average incident costs; and manufacturing SMEs saw their costs drop to a five-year low. Conversely, the financial services sector appears to have experienced a sharp increase in incident costs, which continues to underscore the fact that cyber risk can—and usually does—evolve in different ways for different sectors.

The ~$40k gap and significant correlation between incident costs and payouts underscores the particular value of cyber insurance in mitigating issues, helping insureds avoid uncovered costs. Organizations must continue to move beyond a reactive stance and adopt a proactive, holistic approach to cyber risk.

The number and type of claims emanating from third party incidents, such as claims from thousands of businesses affected by “industry” incidents like the MOVEit Transfer, Change Healthcare and CDK Global events, will be substantial—with significant economic impact to carriers. This impact clearly justifies additional inquiry into third party risk during the underwriting process. It highlights the need to require prospective insureds to have vendor management programs and to provide proof of these programs during the underwriting process. Doing so will not only facilitate more secure networks but will also produce much better underwriting risks. Sean B. Hoar, Partner & Chair, Constangy Cyber Team © 2024 NetDiligence® Version 1.1 10 NETDILIGENCE® CYBER CLAIMS STUDY 2024 REPORT Incident and Crisis Services Costs For all organizations, crisis services costs ranged from SMEs less than $100 to almost $26M. Incident cost for these claims, inclusive of SIR, ranged from less than $1,000 At SMEs, average crisis services costs ranged from to almost $110M. The averages were influenced by $69K in 2019 to $146K in 2023, as shown in Figure 12. some very expensive claims.

This becomes very evident during the recovery process for a client where it’s clear they haven’t planned for resilience in their digital platform nor practiced operating their business processes during a crisis scenario. Helping educate companies on their digital systemic risks and build a proper resiliency plan for the business is vital.

Effective risk selection avoiding the most significant ransomware risk vectors, combined with vigilant monitoring for these controls, and proactive alerting are crucial strategies in preventing these attacks, thereby avoiding the substantial claims and financial losses they can incur. Ben Duffy, KYND © 2024 NetDiligence® Version 1.1 32 NETDILIGENCE® CYBER CLAIMS STUDY 2024 REPORT Ransomware The number of ransomware incidents increased from 553 in 2019 to 749 in 2021. For 2022 and 2023, the incident counts stand at 277 and 244 so far, with additional incidents to be added to the total in the 2025 and 2026 Cyber Claims Reports.3 Ransom amounts and total incident cost have increased dramatically over the past five years. The average cost of a ransomware incident decreased slightly in 2023 when compared to costs in 2020, 2021, and 2022. This is almost certainly due to the small number of ransomware claims collected for 2023 so far. Average Incident Cost—All Ransomware Claims SMEs (N=2,580) Figure 33 3 Each year, we collect data from the three previous years. For this report (2024) we collected claims for 2021-2023. We will continue to collect claims for incidents in 2023 for two more years. © 2024 NetDiligence® Version 1.1 33 NETDILIGENCE® CYBER CLAIMS STUDY 2024 REPORT Average Incident Cost—All Ransomware Claims Large Companies (N=81) Figure 34 © 2024 NetDiligence® Version 1.1 34 NETDILIGENCE® CYBER CLAIMS STUDY 2024 REPORT Business Email Compromise (BEC) BEC was the second leading cause of loss at SMEs. The number of BEC claims per year has been consistent over the past five years, ranging from 305 in 2022 to 393 in 2020. The 242 claims in 2023 are a result of limited data collection in 2024—this number will surely increase in next year’s report. The cost of BEC incidents had been dropping until 2023, from a low of $91/92K in 2019-2020 to a high of $193K in 2023. Average Incident Cost —Business Email Compromise SMEs (N=1,669) Figure 35 The consistency of the number of BEC claims impacting SMEs highlights the effectiveness of social engineering and the ongoing need for effective training and preventative measures. MFA cannot be viewed as a silver bullet. The implementation of preventative protocols and tools is a must. Lindsay B. Nickle, Partner & Vice-Chair, Constangy Cyber Team © 2024 NetDiligence® Version 1.1 35 NETDILIGENCE® CYBER CLAIMS STUDY 2024 REPORT Hackers Hackers were the third leading cause of loss at SMEs. Figure 36 below tells the good news: based on the five-year data, the average cost of a hacking incident has dropped since 2019 and has remained low since then. Average Incident Cost —Hackers SMEs (N=1,091) Figure 36 © 2024 NetDiligence® Version 1.1 36 NETDILIGENCE® CYBER CLAIMS STUDY 2024 REPORT Wire Transfer Fraud Wire transfer fraud was the fourth leading cause of loss at SMEs. Organizations of all sizes were victims (annual revenue $40K–$1.2B; average=$70M). Based upon the five-year data, the average cost of a wire transfer fraud incident has dropped steadily since 2019. Average Incident Cost—Wire Transfer Fraud SMEs (N=467) Figure 37 © 2024 NetDiligence® Version 1.1 37 NETDILIGENCE® CYBER CLAIMS STUDY 2024 REPORT Staff Mistakes Over the period 2019-2023, the number of incidents involving staff mistakes and programming errors has been steadily declining. The number of claims during the current five-year period (2019–2023) has decreased to 150 from 235 reported last year. While none of these events has proven too costly, there is no clear pattern to be discerned. Average Incident Cost—Staff Mistakes SMEs (N=150) Figure 38 © 2024 NetDiligence® Version 1.1 38 NETDILIGENCE® CYBER CLAIMS STUDY 2024 REPORT Rogue Employees Over the past five years, the number and magnitude of incidents caused by malicious employees and ex-employees have also been declining. The number of incidents decreased from 65 in 2019 to 7 in 2023. The average incident cost decreased from $116K in 2020 to $25K in 2023. Average Incident Cost—Rogue Employees SMEs (N=65) Figure 39 © 2024 NetDiligence® Version 1.1 39 NETDILIGENCE® CYBER CLAIMS STUDY 2024 REPORT Third-party Incidents Third-party incidents can be caused by both malicious and non-malicious actors, and they remain a notable cause of loss. Since 2019, the cost of third-party events caused by malicious actors has been much greater than events stemming from non-malicious accidents or mistakes. Unfortunately, the cost of a third-party incident caused by a malicious actor has increased dramatically since 2019. We may expect the 2023 numbers to rise as more claims are collected over the next two cycles. Average Incident Cost—Third Parties SMEs (N=170) Figure 40 In today’s interconnected world, a cyberattack can ripple through the supply chain, impacting not just direct partners but fourth, fifth, and even sixth-party vendors within the supply chain. Targeting the intersection of data and technology, each attack has the potential to affect thousands of businesses and millions of consumers. Adopting a concentric circle of protection is crucial. This involves three key elements rooted in awareness, rapid response, and layered defenses. Integrating these strategies helps to create a robust defense against the expansive reach of modern cyberattacks. Michael Bruemmer, Experian © 2024 NetDiligence® Version 1.1 40 NETDILIGENCE® CYBER CLAIMS STUDY 2024 REPORT Sectors As measured by the number of claims over five years, These five sectors accounted for 52% of all claims and the top five affected business sectors at SMEs are the 59% of all total incident cost at SMEs. same as in last year’s report: Although the rank order changes from year to year, z Professional Services most of these sectors have been at the top of the list z Healthcare for many years.

The average and maximum annual revenue of these firms was similar to those in last year’s report: $55M and $1.5B. At SMEs, professional services claims accounted for 20% of all claims and 23% of total incident cost greater than $1K. Total incident cost ranged from 1K to $30M. The top causes of loss were the same as in the 2023 Claims Study: ransomware, BEC, and hackers. Figure 42 shows the year-by- year and five-year average Average Incident Cost—Professional Services incident cost for this sector. SMEs (N=1,630) Figure 42 This study shows the resilience of cyber criminals and the inconsistency of their tactics. While increased law enforcement efforts and international cooperation have reduced the number of overall incidents, ransomware and BECs continue at a brisk pace. Attackers have more widely distributed their activities to less experienced operators, making their demands less consistent and exploits less successful. One point of consistency remains— attackers remain focused on industries with the most at risk in the event to data loss—professional services and health care. Richard Goldberg, Partner & Vice-Chair, Constangy Cyber Team © 2024 NetDiligence® Version 1.1 42 NETDILIGENCE® CYBER CLAIMS STUDY 2024 REPORT Manufacturing The average annual revenue of organizations in the manufacturing sector was $124M (maximum=$1.9B). Manufacturing claims accounted for 9% of all claims and 11% of total incident cost at SMEs. Total incident cost ranged from 1K to $13.6M. The top causes of loss were ransomware, BEC, and wire transfer fraud. Figure 43 below shows the year-by-year and five-year average incident cost for this sector.
