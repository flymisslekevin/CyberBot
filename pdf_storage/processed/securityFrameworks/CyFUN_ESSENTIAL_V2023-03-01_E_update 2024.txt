CyberFundamentals ESSENTIAL
Introduction
The CyberFundamentals Framework is a set of concrete measures to:
• protect data,
• significantly reduce the risk of the most common cyber-attacks,
• increase an organisation's cyber resilience.
The requirements and guidance are complemented with the relevant insights included in NIST/CSF
framework, ISO 27001/ISO 27002, IEC 62443 and the CIS Critical security Controls (ETSI TR 103 305-1).
The coding of the requirements corresponds with the codes used in the NIST CSF Framework. Since
not all NIST CSF requirements are applicable, some codes that do exist in the NIST CSF framework may
be missing.
The framework and the proportional approach of the assurance levels are validated by practitioners in
the field and using anonymized real-world cyber-attack information provided by the federal Cyber
Emergency Response Team (CERT - the operational service of the Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium).
The CyberFundamentals Framework is built around five core functions: identify, protect, detect,
respond, and recover. These functions allow, regardless of the organization and industry, to promote
communication around cybersecurity among both technical practitioners and stakeholders so that
cyber-related risks can be incorporated into the overall risk management strategy of the organization.
• Identify
Know important cyber threats to your most valuable assets. Essentially, you can't protect what you
don't know exists. This function helps develop an organizational understanding of how to manage
cyber security risks related to systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities.
• Protect
The protect function focuses on developing and implementing the
safeguards necessary to mitigate or contain a cyber risk.
• Detect
The purpose of the Detect function is to ensure the timely detection of
cyber security events.
• Respond
The Respond function is all about the controls that help respond to
cyber security incidents. The Respond function supports the ability to
contain the impact of a potential cyber security incident.
• Recover
The Recover function focuses on those safeguards that help maintain resilience and restore
services that have been affected by a cyber security incident.
To respond to the severity of the threat an organisation is exposed to, in addition to the starting level
Small, 3 assurance levels are provided: Basic, Important and Essential.
The starting level Small allows an organisation to make an initial assessment. It is intended for micro-
organisations or organisations with limited technical knowledge.
The assurance level Basic contains the standard information security measures for all enterprises.
These provide an effective security value with technology and processes that are generally already
available. Where justified, the measures are tailored and refined.

CyberFundamentals ESSENTIAL
Building on the Basic level, security measures are supplemented to protect organisations from
increased cyber risks to achieve a higher level of assurance.
The assurance level Important is designed to minimise the risks of targeted cyber-attacks by actors
with common skills and resources in addition to known cyber security risks.
The assurance level Essential goes a step further to also respond to the risk of advanced cyber-attacks
by actors with extensive skills and resources.
Several controls require particular attention; These measures are labelled as - key measure -.
The framework is a living document and will continue to be updated and improved considering the
feedback received from stakeholders, evolving risk of specific cybersecurity threats, availability of
technical solutions and progressive insight.

Asset Management (ID.AM)
The data, personnel, devices, systems, and facilities that enable the
organization to achieve business purposes are identified and managed
consistent with their relative importance to organizational objectives
and the organization’s risk strategy.
ID.AM-1: Physical devices and systems used within the organization are inventoried.
An inventory of assets associated with information and information processing facilities
within the organization shall be documented, reviewed, and updated when changes occur.
Guidance
• This inventory includes fixed and portable computers, tablets, mobile phones, Programmable Logic
Controllers (PLCs), sensors, actuators, robots, machine tools, firmware, network switches, routers,
power supplies, and other networked components or devices.
• This inventory must include all assets, whether or not they are connected to the organization's
network.
• The use of an IT asset management tool could be considered.
The inventory of assets associated with information and information processing facilities
shall reflect changes in the organization’s context and include all information necessary for
effective accountability.
Guidance
• Inventory specifications include for example, manufacturer, device type, model, serial number,
machine names and network addresses, physical location…
• Accountability is the obligation to explain, justify, and take responsibility for one's actions, it implies
answerability for the outcome of the task or process.
• Changes include the decommissioning of material.
When unauthorized hardware is detected, it shall be quarantined for possible exception
handling, removed, or replaced, and the inventory shall be updated accordingly.
Guidance
• Any unsupported hardware without an exception documentation, is designated as unauthorized.
• Unauthorized hardware can be detected during inventory, requests for support by the user or other
means.
Mechanisms for detecting the presence of unauthorized hardware and firmware
components within the organization's network shall be identified.
Guidance
• Where safe and feasible, these mechanisms should be automated.
• There should be a process to address unauthorized assets on a frequently basis; The organization may
choose to remove the asset from the network, deny the asset from connecting remotely to the
network, or quarantine the asset.

ID.AM-3: Organizational communication and data flows are mapped.
Information that the organization stores and uses shall be identified.
Guidance
• Start by listing all the types of information your business stores or uses. Define “information type” in
any useful way that makes sense to your business. You may want to have your employees make a list
of all the information they use in their regular activities. List everything you can think of, but you do
not need to be too specific. For example, you may keep customer names and email addresses, receipts
for raw material, your banking information, or other proprietary information.
• Consider mapping this information with the associated assets identified in the inventories of physical
devices, systems, software platforms and applications used within the organization (see ID.AM-1 &
ID.AM-2).
All connections within the organization's ICT/OT environment, and to other organization-
internal platforms shall be mapped, documented, approved, and updated as appropriate.
Guidance
• Connection information includes, for example, the interface characteristics, data characteristics, ports,
protocols, addresses, description of the data, security requirements, and the nature of the connection.
• Configuration management can be used as supporting asset.
• This documentation should not be stored only on the network it represents.
• Consider keeping a copy of this documentation in a safe offline environment (e.g. offline hard disk,
paper hardcopy, …).
The information flows/data flows within the organization’s ICT/OT environment, as well as
to other organization-internal systems shall be mapped, documented, authorized, and
updated when changes occur.
Guidance
• With knowledge of the information/data flows within a system and between systems, it is possible to
determine where information can and cannot go.
• Consider:
Enforcing controls restricting connections to only authorized interfaces.
o
Heightening system monitoring activity whenever there is an indication of increased risk to
o
organization's critical operations and assets.
Protecting the system from information leakage due to electromagnetic signals emanations.

ID.AM-4: External information systems are catalogued.
The organization shall map, document, authorize and when changes occur, update, all
external services and the connections made with them.
Guidance
• Outsourcing of systems, software platforms and applications used within the organization is covered
in ID.AM-1 & ID.AM-2
• External information systems are systems or components of systems for which organizations typically
have no direct supervision and authority over the application of security requirements and controls,
or the determination of the effectiveness of implemented controls on those systems i.e., services that
are run in cloud, SaaS, hosting or other external environments, API (Application Programming
Interface)…
• Mapping external services and the connections made to them and authorizing them in advance avoids
wasting unnecessary resources investigating a supposedly non-authenticated connection to external
systems.
The flow of information to/from external systems shall be mapped, documented,
authorized, and update when changes occur.
Guidance
Consider requiring external service providers to identify and document the functions, ports, protocols,
and services necessary for the connection services.

ID.AM-5: Resources are prioritized based on their classification, criticality, and business
value.
The organization’s resources (hardware, devices, data, time, personnel, information, and
software) shall be prioritized based on their classification, criticality, and business value.
Guidance
• Determine organization’s resources (e.g., hardware, devices, data, time, personnel, information, and
software):
What would happen to my business if these resources were made public, damaged, lost…?
o
What would happen to my business when the integrity of resources is no longer guaranteed?
o
What would happen to my business if I/my customers couldn’t access these resources? And rank these
o
resources based on their classification, criticality, and business value.
• Resources should include enterprise assets.
• Create a classification for sensitive information by first determining categories, e.g.
Public - freely accessible to all, even externally
o
Internal - accessible only to members of your organization
o
Confidential - accessible only to those whose duties require access.
o
• Communicate these categories and identify what types of data fall into these categories (HR data,
financial data, legal data, personal data, etc.).
• Consider the use of the Traffic Light Protocol (TLP).
• Data classification should apply to the three aspects: C-I-A
• Consider implementing an automated tool, such as a host-based Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tool to
identify all sensitive data stored, processed, or transmitted through enterprise assets, including those
located onsite or at a remote service provider.

ID.BE-5: Resilience requirements to support delivery of critical services are established
for all operating states (e.g. under duress/attack, during recovery, normal
operations).
To support cyber resilience and secure the delivery of critical services, the necessary
requirements are identified, documented and their implementation tested and approved.
Guidance
• Consider implementing resiliency mechanisms to support normal and adverse operational situations
(e.g., failsafe, load balancing, hot swap).
• Consider aspects of business continuity management in e.g. Business Impact Analyse (BIA), Disaster
Recovery Plan (DRP) and Business Continuity Plan (BCP).
Information processing & supporting facilities shall implement redundancy to meet
availability requirements, as defined by the organization and/or regulatory frameworks.
Guidance
• Consider provisioning adequate data and network redundancy (e.g. redundant network devices,
servers with load balancing, raid arrays, backup services, 2 separate datacentres, fail-over network
connections, 2 ISP's…).
• Consider protecting critical equipment/services from power outages and other failures due to utility
interruptions (e.g. UPS & NO-break, frequent test, service contracts that include regular
maintenance, redundant power cabling, 2 different power service providers...).
Recovery time and recovery point objectives for the recovery of essential ICT/OT system
processes shall be defined.
Guidance
• Consider applying the 3-2-1 back-up rule to improve RPO and RTO (maintain at least 3 copies of your

PR.AC-1: Identities and credentials are issued, managed, verified, revoked, and audited
for authorized devices, users, and processes.
Identities and credentials for authorized devices and users shall be managed.
- key measure -
Guidance
Identities and credentials for authorized devices and users could be managed through a password policy.
A password policy is a set of rules designed to enhance ICT/OT security by encouraging organization’s to
(Not limitative list and measures to be considered as appropriate):
• Change all default passwords.
• Ensure that no one works with administrator privileges for daily tasks.
• Keep a limited and updated list of system administrator accounts.
• Enforce password rules, e.g. passwords must be longer than a state-of-the-art number of characters
with a combination of character types and changed periodically or when there is any suspicion of
compromise.
• Use only individual accounts and never share passwords.
• Immediately disable unused accounts.
• Rights and privileges are managed by user groups.
Identities and credentials for authorized devices and users shall be managed, where feasible
through automated mechanisms.
Guidance
• Automated mechanisms can help to support the management and auditing of information system
credentials.
• Consider strong user authentication, meaning an authentication based on the use of at least two
authentication factors from different categories of either knowledge (something only the user
knows), possession (something only the user possesses) or inherence (something the user is) that are
independent, in that the breach of one does not compromise the reliability of the others, and is
designed in such a way to protect the confidentiality of the authentication data.
System credentials shall be deactivated after a specified period of inactivity unless it would
compromise the safe operation of (critical) processes.
Guidance
• To guarantee the safe operation, service accounts should be used for running processes and services.
• Consider the use of a formal access procedure for external parties.

Guidance
Means to get access may include: a key, password, code, or administrative privilege.
Employee access to data and information shall be limited to the systems and specific
information they need to do their jobs (the principle of Least Privilege).
- key measure -
Guidance
• The principle of Least Privilege should be understood as the principle that a security architecture
should be designed so that each employee is granted the minimum system resources and
authorizations that the employee needs to perform its function.
• Consider to:
Not allow any employee to have access to all the business’s information.
o
Limit the number of Internet accesses and interconnections with partner networks to the
o
strict necessary to be able to centralize and homogenize the monitoring of exchanges more
easily.
Ensure that when an employee leaves the business, all access to the business’s information
o
or systems is blocked instantly.
Separation of duties shall be ensured in the management of access rights.
Guidance
Separation of duties includes, for example:
• dividing operational functions and system support functions among different roles.
• conducting system support functions with different individuals.
• not allow a single individual to both initiate and approve a transaction (financial or otherwise).
• ensuring that security personnel administering access control functions do not also administer audit
functions.

Guidance
Consider the following:
• Install and operate a firewall between your internal network and the Internet. This may be a function
of a (wireless) access point/router, or it may be a function of a router provided by the Internet Service
Provider (ISP).
• Ensure there is antivirus software installed on purchased firewall solutions and ensure that the
administrator’s log-in and administrative password is changed upon installation and regularly
thereafter.
• Install, use, and update a software firewall on each computer system (including smart phones and
other networked devices).
• Have firewalls on each of your computers and networks even if you use a cloud service provider or a
virtual private network (VPN). Ensure that for telework home network and systems have hardware
and software firewalls installed, operational, and regularly updated.
• Consider installing an Intrusion Detection / Prevention System (IDPS). These devices analyse network
traffic at a more detailed level and can provide a greater level of protection.
Where appropriate, network integrity of the organization's critical systems shall be protected
by incorporating network segmentation and segregation.
- key measure -
Guidance
• Consider creating different security zones in the network (e.g. basic network segmentation through
VLAN’s or other network access control mechanisms) and control/monitor the traffic between these
zones.
• When the network is "flat", the compromise of a vital network component can lead to the compromise
of the entire network.

PR.PT-4: Communications and control networks are protected.
Web and e-mail filters shall be installed and used.
Guidance
• E-mail filters should detect malicious e-mails, and filtering should be configured based on the type of
message attachments so that files of the specified types are automatically processed (e.g. deleted).
• Web-filters should notify the user if a website may contain malware and potentially preventing users
from accessing that website.
The organization shall control the information flows/data flows within its critical systems
and between interconnected systems.
Guidance
Consider the following:
• Information flow may be supported, for example, by labelling or colouring physical connectors as an
aid to manual hook-up.
• Inspection of message content may enforce information flow policy. For example, a message
containing a command to an actuator may not be permitted to flow between the control network
and any other network.
• Physical addresses (e.g., a serial port) may be implicitly or explicitly associated with labels or
attributes (e.g., hardware I/O address). Manual methods are typically static. Label or attribute policy
mechanisms may be implemented in hardware, firmware, and software that controls or has device
access, such as device drivers and communications controllers.
