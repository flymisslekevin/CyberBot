About the cover
Third-party involvement in breaches
was an ever-present subject in incidents
throughout this past year. Third parties
not only act as custodians to customers’
data, but they also underpin critical
parts of organizations’ operations.
Our incredible design team rose
to the challenge of representing
the balancing act an organization’s
security programs have to perform
with the growing dependence on
those third parties. If the impossibly
balanced shape on the cover makes
you uncomfortable, you have begun
to understand the challenges modern
Chief Information Security Officers
(CISOs) face in the current environment.

encoded the Incident Classification
Patterns that were most prevalent
in breaches in our incident dataset
(with the previous year’s data
oriented to the left of the center and
the current year’s data to the right).
The inner cover represents those
quantities in a less abstract way.
The shape might look too fragile to
continue standing, but the fact that
it is holding steady is a monument to
all the hard work and collaboration
that the industry has brought to
bear. With the proper amount of
collaboration, organization and
information sharing, we can continue
to strengthen cybersecurity efforts

Summary of findings
The exploitation of vulnerabilities has
seen another year of growth as an initial
access vector for breaches, reaching
20%. This value approaches that of
credential abuse, which is still the most
common vector. This was an increase
of 34% in relation to last year’s report
and was supported, in part, by zero-
day exploits targeting edge devices
and virtual private networks (VPNs).
The percentage of edge devices and
VPNs as a target on our exploitation of
vulnerabilities action was 22%, and it
grew almost eight-fold12 from the 3%
found in last year’s report. Organizations
worked very hard to patch those edge
device vulnerabilities, but our analysis
Figure 5. Known initial access vectors in non-Error, non-Misuse breaches (n=9,891) showed only about 54% of those were
fully remediated throughout the year,
and it took a median of 32 days
to accomplish.
The presence of Ransomware, with or
without encryption, in our dataset also
saw significant growth—a 37% increase
from last year’s report. It was present in
44% of all the breaches we reviewed, up
from 32%. In some good news, however,
the median amount paid to ransomware
groups has decreased to $115,000 (from
$150,000 last year). 64% of the victim
organizations did not pay the ransoms,
which was up from 50% two years ago.
This could be partially responsible for
the declining ransom amounts.
Ransomware is also disproportionally
affecting small organizations. In larger
organizations, Ransomware is a
component of 39% of breaches, while
SMBs experienced Ransomware-related
breaches to the tune of 88% overall.

Although the involvement of the human
element in breaches remained roughly
the same as last year, hovering around
60%, the percentages of breaches

doubled, going from 15% to 30%.
There were notable incidents this year

environment—in which our research

We also saw significant growth in
Espionage-motivated breaches in

in our contributor makeup. Those

their compensation.
2025 DBIR Summary of findings 11
With regard to stolen credentials,
analysis performed on information
stealer malware (infostealer) credential
logs revealed that 30% of the
compromised systems can be identified
as enterprise-licensed devices.
However, 46% of those compromised
systems that had corporate logins in
their compromised data were non-
managed and were hosting both
personal and business credentials.
These are most likely attributable to a
BYOD program or are enterprise-owned
devices being used outside of the
permissible policy.
By correlating infostealer logs and
marketplace postings with the
internet domains of victims that were
disclosed by ransomware actors in
2024, we saw that 54% of those
victims had their domains show up in
the credential dumps (for instance, as
URLs the credentials allegedly gave
access to), and 40% of the victims had

the compromised credentials. This
suggests these credentials could have
been leveraged for those ransomware
breaches, pointing to potential access
broker involvement as a source of initial
access vectors.
2025 DBIR Summary of findings 12
As of early 2025, generative artificial
intelligence (GenAI) has still not taken
over the world, even though there is
evidence of its use by threat actors as
reported by the AI platforms themselves.
Also, according to data provided by one
of our partners, synthetically generated
text in malicious emails has doubled
over the past two years.
A closer-to-home emerging threat from
AI is the potential for corporate-sensitive
data leakage to the GenAI platforms
themselves, as 15% of employees were
routinely accessing GenAI systems on
their corporate devices (at least once
every 15 days). Even more concerning, a
large number of those were either using
non-corporate emails as the identifiers
of their accounts (72%) or were
using their corporate emails without
integrated authentication systems in
place (17%), most likely suggesting
use outside of corporate policy.

In the previous edition of the DBIR, we decided that it would be interesting to start
tracking a new metric about third-party involvement in breaches. We enjoy joking
about those occasions when we are wrong about “predicting” something in the
report, but we suppose it’s time to have a serious conversation about when we
are not. For this year, we found third-party involvement of some sort in 30% of all
breaches we analyzed, up from roughly 15% last year. Figure 10 provides a tonally

Figure 29. CVE type resolution by remediation status
When you realize that the partially
remediated options have the highest
percentages compared to both of the
other vulnerability samples, this kind
of strategy becomes clear, and its
popularity undeniable.
As for the “Unremediated,” all we can
offer is a sincere “Good luck!” Given
the volume and frequency of which
those vulnerabilities were exploited, the
30% of unmitigated vulnerabilities will
have caused a lot of trouble for those
organizations throughout the year. One
possibility for this large number is that
it is likely organizations only have one
asset (or a few load-balanced assets)
of those kinds, so the fully remediated
versus unremediated becomes a very
binary affair.
Figure 30. Distribution of the median of days until full remediation of vulnerabilities
in our edge device subset in a single company (n=431 – each dot is 2.15 unique
companies)
2025 DBIR Results and analysis 30
The overall median time for full
remediation also shows positive trends.
For the whole CISA KEV catalog, the
median is 38 days for a company to fully
remediate one of their vulnerabilities,
while for our edge vulnerability subset,
the same figure comes up as 32 days,
as Figure 30 demonstrates. This is
another piece of evidence pointing to
the proper prioritization of remediation
of edge device vulnerabilities.
However, as teased a few paragraphs
ago, there is also bad news to share.
We have made the definition of our
metric of time to mass exploit a bit more
generous,61 in order to really have an
upper bound on those values. We are
comparing the day of publication in the
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
(CVE) database with the date of it
being added to the CISA KEV catalog,62
since it’s likely that if it hit the KEV list,
the vulnerability is bound to have been
causing some damage already. Figure 31. Distribution of difference in days between CVE and CISA KEV publication
(n=292 – each dots 5.84 vulns)
Even by relaxing our definition, Figure
31 shows that the estimate of a median
of five days for a CISA KEV vulnerability
to be mass exploited still holds from our
findings from last year. And even more
concerning, the median time for our
edge device vulnerability subset was,
you guessed it, zero. We didn’t need a lot
of math for that one because 9 of the 17
were published on the KEV list the day
of or earlier than their CVE publication.
Figure 32 makes that clear.
The work never ends. It seems futile in
the face of the odds, but it is very likely
that outcomes would be much worse
if mitigating measures were not being
taken. One must ask Camus if Sisyphus
would still find contentment and
fulfillment if his mountain was infinite, the
day unending. He is constantly denied
the period of solace and contemplation
on his completed task, even if for a
moment. If Camus is not available to
answer, perhaps we should ask a CISO.
Figure 32. Distribution of difference in days between CVE and CISA KEV publication
in selected edge device vulnerabilities (n=17 – each dot is 0.94 vulns)
61. Even though we seem to be being generous to the vulnerabilities themselves here, you do not, under any
circumstances, “gotta hand it to them.”
62. We have limited this analysis to vulnerabilities from 2022 onwards because the catalog was created in
November of 2021.

Same tactics,
different year
When discussing Ransomware, it is
important to note that it really captures
the monetization of system access,
and that around 42% of breaches
involve compromised credentials,
an exploited vulnerability or the use
of phishing. Although the tactics are
similar, the scale upon which they are
being leveraged differs from year to year
(Figure 45). This may not be surprising
given the fact that in certain years,
Figure 45. Known initial access vectors over time in Ransomware action breaches
widely exploited zero-days can be
(n in 2025 dataset=4,630)
dropped and used against thousands of
organizations over the course of a single
weekend. This type of activity accounts
for the large increase in exploiting
vulnerabilities that we witnessed
this year and the last year.
However, what we find interesting is
that while the number of exploited
vulnerabilities in Ransomware has
dropped from last year,77 it’s still much
higher than any of the previous years,
having doubled since 2022.
77. Which was overrepresenting vulnerabilities like MOVEit
2025 DBIR Incident Classification Patterns 40
This could be an indication that it may
become a more frequent tactic so
long as it continues to pay off. Another
interesting element is that we’re seeing
both state-sponsored actors and
financially motivated actors leverage
vulnerabilities as a common way to
compromise organizations, which
highlights the broad range of appeal
that these vulnerable systems have
to attackers.
Turning tides?
Based on our data, ransomware is
clearly still a preferred tactic, but how
much are those ransoms actually?
In the past, we have leveraged the
very detailed data of the FBI Internet
Crime Complaint Center (IC3) around
the transfer of funds to threat actors
reported to them by victims. This year,
we are trying something a bit different:
Because of the kind contribution of
data partners in cyber insurance and
ransomware negotiations, we could
get a good glimpse of what the values
were around paid-out ransoms. Then
we combined this additional data with
the IC3 dataset, as those should line up
in the timeline of the “ransom payment
cycle” and actually be from the same
point in time, after ransom payment and
before law enforcement intervention.
You can see the results for the last three
years in Figure 46. For the calendar year
2024, the median ransom paid comes up
as $115,000, which is a decrease from
$150,000 in the previous year.
A median of $150,000 in the 2023
calendar year is significantly higher
than our previously reported $46,000
in the 2024 DBIR, but we are now
drawing from a larger sample, involving Figure 46. Distribution of loss due to ransom payment in USD (2022–2024)

Pushing the
Wizardtrolley
Another persistent issue that we have
reported on as part of this pattern
is Magecart infections, in which
e-commerce sites are compromised
with malware that siphons out payment
card data during checkout. These
attacks make up the other main type
of incidents seen in System Intrusion.
They represent 1% of System Intrusion
breaches and 80% of breaches
involving payment cards. However, we
still believe those are not getting a lot of
representation in our incident dataset,
so we decided to do a deeper dive into
the data to figure out what we could find.
By reviewing a large-scale, multiple-year
dataset involving Magecart from one of Figure 48. Monthly vistors to Magecart-compromised sites
our data contributors, we’ve determined (n=43,324 – each dot is 216.62 websites)
that this type of attack seems to cover
multiple countries and industries. The
threat actors appear to be driven largely
by opportunity rather than by targeting
the largest vendors. The median monthly
visitor count to the affected websites
is around 7,000 (Figure 48), and the
median infection time of the websites is
less than 30 days (Figure 49).
We do not know how many of those
monthly visitors end up entering their
credit card details and having them
stolen, but it seems to be profitable
enough for the criminals to continue
doing it. But although these actors are
clever in terms of hiding their payloads
from the regular user, they leverage
many of the same tactics of exploiting
vulnerabilities and using stolen
credentials to compromise e-commerce
sites, regardless of size.

consistent and has settled around the
$50,000 mark. This number is based on

To gain an understanding of what are
in those logs, we did a sampling of
different sources and examined the
types of domains being collected.
Figure 59 has a breakdown of the types
of domains found in these logs, and it
should be of no surprise that streaming,
gaming and social media were
commonplace in each of the different
sources. For the more entrepreneurial
criminals, such ease of access to
credentials and cookies, even in the
free samples, might present a tempting
target for account takeovers. Also
interesting is how similar each of the
different log sources were, which may
indicate that it is not what is for sale as
much as how quickly and how many you
can get that is the market differentiator
between the different sources.
Another slice of data we wanted to

may be biases in this specific number.
With that in mind, we took an additional
approach of looking at the version of

was that about 34% of the Windows

Industries
66 2025 Data Breach Investigations Report
Introduction
Welcome to the “Industries” section of the 2025 DBIR! If you are dipping your toes
into the murky water of data breaches for the first time, please think of this as your
road map. If, on the other hand, you are a frequent visitor to this report, you may feel
free to skip ahead, as you most likely already know the way.
As mentioned in the introduction, this year we examined 22,052 security incidents, of
which 12,195 were confirmed data breaches. In this section, we break those incidents
and breaches down and look at them from an industry-specific perspective. As one
might imagine, what one industry wrestles with frequently, another industry may rarely
encounter. The differences between the threats various industries face often come
down to each organization’s unique attack surface.
A multinational financial institution, for instance, may face a different set of threats
than a regional logistics company. However, in many cases, there may also be a
surprising amount of overlap between the two. At the end of the day, as we point out
elsewhere in this report, threat actors appear to care less about an organization’s
size, industry vertical or geographical location than one might think. Today’s
cybercriminal is a bit of a pragmatist and largely subscribes to the “I’ll be happy to
steal whatever you have on hand” view. To really understand this section, you must
also keep in mind other variables, such as the differing reporting requirements that
might exist between industries and the corresponding level of scrutiny that they may
receive, the overall sample size that we have for a given industry and so on. Therefore,
we caution you to keep these and other factors in mind when judging the security
posture of any particular vertical.
Due to a recent re-org of the report, we were forced to make some hard decisions
about the industries we cover, and we now discuss in detail five, rather than the nine
that we examined previously. We appreciate all the contributions that the other four
industries made to this report, and we wish them well in their future endeavors.
If you are here for specific insights that are tailored to your industry,104 we recommend
that you spend time reviewing the top patterns for your industry and then going back
to read up on the relevant pattern sections of the report associated with your vertical.
Speaking of verticals, although we do not have sufficient space, time or, in some
cases, data to examine all industry verticals in depth, we have provided Table 3 on
the next page, which illustrates high-level information on the industries that we do not
touch upon in greater detail. And finally, Public Administration (now “Public Sector”)
has been promoted from this section and is showcased, along with small- to medium-
sized businesses, later in this report (in the “Focused analysis” section).
104. Of course you are. Why else would you be reading this in the first place?

Summary
The Retail industry has seen an increase
in cyber incidents, though the focus has
shifted from Payment card data to other
data types that are easier to access.
There was a notable rise in Espionage-
motivated attacks as compared to last
year. Defenders should be aware of
more sophisticated and harder-to-
detect threats.

As for our top three patterns, this year
shows absolutely no change—not in
the makeup of the top three or even
what order they rank (Figure 88). And
as far as threats go, it seems you will
just be facing more of it in the future.
The System Intrusion pattern is typically
where the more sophisticated attacks
land. Ransomware actors fall into this
pattern—ransomware is a problem
across all industries and is only getting
worse. Social Engineering in the second
spot means you need to make sure
your people know how to spot and
appropriately respond to the phishing
and pretexting lures they will receive.
Controls to stop the attacks from being
successful even when the victim falls
for the bait should also be a priority.
And finally, the Basic Web Application
Attacks pattern shows us that the
simple attacks seem to still work just
fine. Those attacks are largely about
credentials and their reuse. It seems to
be human nature to reuse a password
across multiple sites, and since many
of them use an email address for the
login, the combination is very useful
for criminals in many other places.

Introduction
The process of writing the DBIR is a demanding one, and as a team, we rarely get a
chance to step back and do more in-depth research into the areas that capture our
interest.107 This year, we decided to treat ourselves and dive a bit deeper into two
topics: We always enjoy revisiting the differences in how small and large organizations
experience cyber events, and we wanted to give some more detail into the huge topic
of Public Sector breaches. While we love all of the industries equally, it is hard not to
see how the government of any country has a wider and more complex attack profile
than any other single industry. We hope these two special focus areas spark joy with
our readers as well.108

Year in review
January The first month of the new year marked significant cybersecurity threats, including zero-day exploits, critical
vulnerabilities and active campaigns by cybercrime and state-sponsored advanced persistent threats (APTs). A
major focus was the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in popular software and hardware. Ivanti’s Connect
Secure products were targeted by the Chinese APT UTA0178, prompting urgent responses, including mandates from
CISA. Citrix also reported active exploitation of two zero-days affecting NetScaler ADC and Gateway. Other critical
vulnerabilities were rapidly exploited, such as CVE-2024-23897 in Jenkins servers, Fortra’s GoAnywhere MFT and
Atlassian Confluence, stressing the risks of delayed patching. Apple, Cisco and Juniper Networks also faced critical
zero-days, including Apple’s first of the year. Cybercrime groups advanced their tactics, leveraging AI tools for BEC
and malware and exploiting Google OAuth APIs for session hijacking. Ransomware remained a key threat, with
insights on the 8Base group’s operations emerging. Nation-state actors were active, with Iranian (Mint Sandstorm) and
Russian APTs (COLDRIVER/Star Blizzard and Midnight Blizzard) conducting notable campaigns. These developments
underscored the urgent need for timely patching, robust threat intelligence and proactive defenses to counter the
persistent and evolving cyberthreat landscape.
February Ivanti remained a focal point, addressing ongoing attacks on its Connect Secure and Policy Secure products by Chinese
APT UNC5221/UTA0178, which also uncovered two new high-severity vulnerabilities. Russia-aligned APTs targeted
Ukraine with USB-based malware, while defenders scored a rare win by dismantling the Chinese threat actor Volt
Typhoon’s KV Botnet. Fortinet mitigated actively exploited Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPN vulnerabilities in FortiOS,
and Microsoft patched 78 vulnerabilities, including three zero-days leveraged by the new cybercrime APT Water Hydra.
Notable intelligence emerged from CrowdStrike and IBM, providing insights into evolving global threat trends. Additional
vulnerabilities surfaced in ConnectWise, VMware, Adobe and Intel products, prompting swift patching efforts. Reports
on the Israeli-Iranian cyber conflict and North Korea’s Kimsuky APT activity underscored the geopolitical complexities
of cyberoperations. Operation Cronos, a joint international law enforcement operation, disrupted the notorious LockBit
ransomware group. The joint operation took control of LockBit’s infrastructure and its affiliate panel and seized
significant information, such as LockBit source code, chats and internal communications; victim details; and decryption
keys. Operation Cronos dealt a significant blow to LockBit’s operations, seizing approximately 2,200 bitcoin and eroding
trust within its affiliate network. However, within days, a new leak site was published with new attacks being claimed,
albeit at a much-reduced capacity.
March Critical flaws in enterprise systems such as Progress Kemp LoadMaster, VMware ESXi, Cisco Secure Client and Fortinet
FortiClient EMS underscored the constant pressure on organizations to maintain up-to-date security infrastructure.
Exploited flaws included newly discovered vulnerabilities in Arcserve’s Unified Data Protection software. APT activity
persisted, with evidence of Russia-linked APT29 (Midnight Blizzard) leveraging previously exfiltrated information from
email systems to gain unauthorized access, showing a tenfold increase since January 2024. China-linked groups
deployed a Linux variant of DinodasRAT, while Iranian and North Korean APTs remained active with evolving tactics.
Cybercriminal campaigns also adapted, including TA577 targeting Windows New Techology LAN Manager (NTLM)
hashes and StrelaStealer malware harvesting email credentials. Urgent updates were announced for JetBrains TeamCity
servers, which faced proof-of-concept exploit code within hours of patch release. A notable campaign targeting VPN
infrastructure through brute force techniques prompted advisories from Verizon. The discovery of trojanized XZ Utils in
Fedora distributions underscored ongoing risks to supply chain integrity. March’s developments reaffirmed the need for
vigilant patching and monitoring of rapidly evolving APT tactics.
April A key focus was the XZ Utils supply chain attack, in which a backdoor introduced through targeted Social Engineering
in 2021 highlighted risks to open-source software. Ivanti’s VPN vulnerabilities remained critical, with organizations
urged to patch flaws in Connect Secure and Policy Secure gateways. Two major breaches dominated the month: CISA
disclosed a Sisense data breach, advising credential resets, while a Duo MFA breach exposed text messaging logs,
further emphasizing the importance of robust authentication. Palo Alto Networks patched a zero-day OS command
injection vulnerability actively exploited in its GlobalProtect firewalls. Midmonth saw Mandiant reclassify Sandworm
Team as APT44, with fresh insights into Russian APT activity. Password-guessing attacks surged, targeting VPN and
SSH interfaces. By month’s end, zero-days in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) firewalls and exploitation of an
older Microsoft print spooler vulnerability by APT28 (Forrest Blizzard) using a previously unknown hacking tool called
GooseEgg. April reinforced the importance of supply chain security and rapid patch management to counter evolving
APT tactics.
2025 DBIR Wrap-up 101
May North Korea’s Moonstone Sleet and Russia’s BlueDelta debuted as new nation-state threats, with Moonstone Sleet
using FakePenny ransomware for cyberespionage and BlueDelta focusing on intelligence operations across Europe
and Asia. Chinese APTs expanded cyberespionage operations to Africa, the Caribbean and the Middle East, with the
refined approach of more carefully selecting its targets and using publicly available tools. Cybercriminal activity also
evolved, with Evil Corp deploying SocGholish malware and FIN7 impersonating trusted brands and using malicious MSIX
files. Zero-day exploitation was a major challenge, including CVE-2024-5274 in Google Chrome’s V8 engine, prompting
five patches throughout the month. Cisco ASA/Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) vulnerabilities were targeted in the
ArcaneDoor campaign, while significant vulnerabilities in F5 BIG-IP and Apache ActiveMQ added to patch management
demands. MITRE Engenuity’s analysis of a 2023 breach provided insights into the China-nexus threat actor’s (UNC5221)
use of using rogue virtual machines created and managed through service accounts directly on the hypervisor rather
than through administrative consoles. The U.S. Department of Justice issued an indictment, charging Russian national
Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev (also known as LockBitSupp) with creating and operating LockBit ransomware. The
unsealing of the indictment was accompanied by the U.S. State Department announcing a $10M bounty for information
that leads to Khoroshev’s apprehension. Verizon’s 2024 Data Breach Investigations Report revealed a tripling in
vulnerability exploitation in breaches, linking zero-days to ransomware.
June Chinese APT Crimson Palace launched targeted cyberespionage campaigns, invariably collecting sensitive technical
information, conducting reconnaissance of specific users and accessing critical IT systems. Meanwhile, Russia-linked
APT28 (Forest Blizzard) remained active, using infostealer malware and living-off-the-land techniques. Espionage-
focused ransomware attacks continued to gain prominence, with Recorded Future identifying RedJuliett, a new Beijing-
aligned group targeting Taiwan. Other emerging China-aligned threat actors, such as SneakyChef, targeted government
entities in Asia and EMEA with SugarGh0st malware, while Velvet Ant exploited legacy F5 BIG-IP appliances for
persistence. BlackSuit ransomware actors breached CDK Global, with tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs)
strongly suggesting it is rebranding of Royal ransomware. Results of investigations into the Snowflake breach also
began to emerge, indicating the threat actors used LummaStealer in its initial access. Critical vulnerabilities required
swift action, including flaws in Fortinet, Juniper Mist Premium Analytics, Progress Telerik and SolarWinds Serv-U. The
MOVEit vulnerability continued to see exploitation attempts, while Atlassian’s Confluence vulnerability saw exploitation
shortly after patch release. June’s developments demonstrated the blurring lines between ransomware and espionage,
highlighting the importance of strong patch management and monitoring APT TTP shifts.
July The open-source JavaScript library project polyfill.io was involved in what was believed to be the largest digital supply
chain attack to date. Polyfill.io was discovered injecting malware and redirecting users to its malicious network of online
gambling and other malicious sites, subjecting hundreds of thousands of users to increased risk. Cisco Nexus switches
faced attacks exploiting vulnerabilities dating back to April, attributed to the Chinese APT Velvet Ant. GootLoader
resumed cybercrime operations after a six-month hiatus, while North Korea’s Kimsuky APT expanded targeting to
Japan. Snowflake’s ongoing breach highlighted risks from compromised credentials, affecting 165 organizations without
MFA enforcement. A faulty software update from CrowdStrike’s Falcon agent caused widespread system failures on
Microsoft Windows devices, impacting critical sectors such as aviation, healthcare and finance. The company issued
patches, faced congressional scrutiny and reported significant quarterly financial losses but retained most of its
customer base.
2025 DBIR Wrap-up 102
August CrowdStrike released a root cause analysis report for the previous month’s massive outage, but adding to its woes, the
company also revealed that spearphishing campaigns exploited its Falcon Sensor outage, distributing Ciro malware
through fake crash report installers. Separately, the hacktivist group USDoD claimed to have leaked CrowdStrike’s
indicators of compromise (IOC) list and threat actor database. Akamai reported successfully mitigating one of the
largest DDoS attacks, blocking more than 419 TB of malicious traffic, and a massive breach at background check firm
National Public Data exposed nearly three billion records. Critical vulnerabilities in ServiceNow’s Now Platform (CVE-
2024-4879 and CVE-2024-5217) led to data breaches, and ransomware groups Akira and Black Basta exploited
an ESXi hypervisor flaw (CVE-2024-37085), driving widespread ransomware deployments. The FBI dismantled the
Dispossessor ransomware group, and CISA flagged RansomHub ransomware, linked to more than 200 attacks since
February. The two agencies also released a joint advisory on Royal ransomware’s rebranding to BlackSuit, detailing
updated tactics and IOCs. Geopolitical cyber activity escalated as Iranian state-sponsored actors combined influence
campaigns and ransomware targeting Healthcare and Financial sectors. Microsoft, Google and the FBI reported details
of various activities by Iranian threat actors targeting the 2024 U.S. presidential election, including attempted hacks
of candidates’ campaigns and influence operations designed to stir up controversy. OpenAI disrupted Iranian-linked
Storm-2035 influence operations leveraging covert propaganda on its platform. Lumen Technologies reported Chinese
APT Volt Typhoon exploiting Versa Director servers (CVE-2024-39717), enabling credential interception and malicious
code injection. VTRAC published a threat intelligence advisory detailing the emerging trend of threat actors using
“violence as a service” in conjunction with their cyberattacks.
September September saw significant developments in cybercrime takedowns, nation-state operations, ransomware tactics and
critical vulnerability exploitation. The U.S. unsealed indictments against two Russian nationals for hacking and fraud
schemes that caused more than $35M in losses, including identity theft and extortion. Separately, a joint FBI, CISA
and National Security Agency (NSA) advisory detailed GRU’s Unit 29155 cyberespionage activities and WhisperGate
attacks targeting Ukraine, which coincided with the unsealing of another indictment naming six Russian officers and one
Russian civilian associated with the GRU unit. Meanwhile, Graphika reported on China’s Spamouflage campaign, which
used fake American personas to spread divisive narratives ahead of U.S. elections. Midmonth, the FBI, enabled by Black
Lotus Labs’ investigation, dismantled the Chinese Flax Typhoon botnet, which comprised more than 200,000 Internet
of Things (IoT) devices under the code name Raptor Train. North Korean actors escalated job-themed phishing attacks
targeting aerospace and IT sectors, even infiltrating organizations via fake hires. KnowBe4 shared its experience in
accidentally hiring one such fake employee, revealing a broader, industrial-scale operation and highlighting the need for
secure hiring and onboarding processes, especially for remote-based employees. Later, law enforcement indicted two
Russian nationals for payment card theft and cryptocurrency laundering. One of the individuals was the alleged operator
of the notorious Joker’s Stash cybercrime marketplace, while the other ran the major money laundering cryptocurrency
exchange, Cryptex. RansomHub ransomware continued targeting critical infrastructure using advanced anti-endpoint
detection and response (EDR) tactics. North Korean APT Kimsuky (Sparkling Pisces) deployed two new malware
variants, KLogEXE and FPSpy. The emergence of LLMjacking, exploiting compromised cloud credentials to abuse large
language models, raised alarms over operational and financial risks.
October Key themes included record-breaking DDoS attacks, nation-state cyberactivity, election security and the persistent
evolution of ransomware and supply chain threats. Early in the month, Cloudflare mitigated a 3.8 Tbps DDoS attack, the
largest on record, driven by compromised ASUS routers and IoT devices. The Gorilla Botnet, a Mirai variant responsible
for 300,000 global attacks in September, continued to target critical infrastructure in the U.S., Canada and Germany
via sophisticated attack vectors. Reports began emerging about a massive cyberespionage campaign conducted by
the Chinese state-sponsored group Salt Typhoon targeting U.S. broadband networks. The sophisticated threat actor
reportedly infiltrated multiple U.S. telecommunication companies, exploited backdoors and stole sensitive data. The
reports subsequently prompted investigations, congressional inquiries and the formation of a Cyber Unified Coordination
Group (UCG) comprising multiple federal agencies to collaborate and coordinate the U.S. response to the attacks. Later
reports, confirmed by White House officials, would indicate the Chinese threat actors had recorded the phone calls of
senior unnamed U.S. political figures. In a win against cyberespionage, the U.S. Department of Justice and Microsoft
seized 100 domains tied to the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation-backed Star Blizzard group. Efforts
against ransomware intensified, with indictments and sanctions against members of the LockBit ransomware group and
Evil Corp cybercrime organization. Ongoing investigations identified Evil Corp as responsible for $300M in damages.
The emergence of Mamba 2FA, a phishing as a service platform, underscored cybercriminals’ focus on bypassing MFA
in AiTM attacks. Dutch authorities dismantled the Bohemia/Cannabia, a dark web market selling drugs and cybercrime
services with a €12M monthly turnover, and OpenAI disrupted 20 malicious operations exploiting its AI models. China’s
Spamouflage operations tested new tactics against Senator Marco Rubio, and the Brazilian authorities arrested USDoD,
a notorious hacker, while the U.S. Department of Justice indicted two Sudanese nationals tied to Anonymous Sudan’s
35,000 DDoS attacks, which caused $10M in damages. The month concluded with Microsoft’s election security report
revealing disinformation campaigns by Russia, Iran and China targeting the 2024 U.S. elections.
2025 DBIR Wrap-up 103
November Reports of a new version of the FakeCall malware emerged early in the month. FakeCall is an advanced vishing attack
capable of intercepting both inbound and outbound calls as well as controlling infected mobile devices and stealing
sensitive data. Google’s Big Sleep team showcased AI’s potential for identifying flaws, uncovering a serious SQLite
vulnerability, while attackers exploited Docusign APIs to distribute convincing phishing invoices, bypassing traditional
defenses through legitimate platforms. Collaborative international law enforcement efforts led to U.S. authorities
indicting Maxim Rudometov for creating the RedLine infostealer. This coincided with an announcement by the Dutch
National Police that it had gained complete access to the servers behind the RedLine and META infostealers. Russian
national Evgenii Ptitsyn, alleged operator of Phobos ransomware, with more than 1,000 victims and $16M in ransom
payments, was extradited from South Korea to the U.S. Separately, five members of Scattered Spider faced charges
for phishing campaigns targeting corporate data and cryptocurrency. A Microsoft report warned of the Chinese threat
actor Storm-0940 targeting various organizations in North America and Europe, including think tanks, government
organizations, non-governmental organizations, law firms and the defense industrial base. The threat actors were
observed leveraging a covert network of compromised small office and home office routers and other networking
devices, known as CovertNetwork-1658 or Quad7 botnet, to conduct password spray attacks. Storm-0940 would
then steal credentials to gain initial access to the targeted organizations, move laterally within the victim’s networks
and exfiltrate data. SecurityScorecard reported a resurgence of Volt Typhoon, which exploited outdated edge devices
and routers targeting critical infrastructure. As the holiday season approached, cybersecurity risks surged, with fake
online stores increasing by 110%, credit card skimming malware targeting Magento sites and AI-driven phishing attacks
becoming more prevalent.
December The year closed with significant developments in critical vulnerability exploitation, ransomware campaigns and a number
of successes in international efforts against cybercrime. The U.S. Department of Justice charged Rostislav Panev,
a LockBit developer, as LockBit announced its 4.0 version for 2025 and, separately, seized the Rydox marketplace,
targeting 18,000 users involved in cybercrime. The U.S. Department of the Treasury sanctioned Iranian, Russian and
Chinese entities for election interference and critical infrastructure attacks, including Iran’s Cognitive Design Production
Center and Russia’s GRU-affiliated Center for Geopolitical Expertise. Operation Destabilise dismantled Russian money-
laundering networks, leading to 84 arrests and £20M in asset seizures, while Europol’s Operation PowerOFF disrupted
27 DDoS-for-hire platforms, arresting administrators and identifying 300 users. Russia also took rare enforcement
actions, charging Mikhail Matveev (Wazawaka) and sentencing Hydra Market’s leader to life imprisonment. Severe
vulnerabilities were disclosed throughout the month of December, including a directory traversal flaw in Zyxel and a
remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Veeam’s Service Provider Console. Cisco highlighted renewed exploitation
of legacy ASA WebVPN vulnerabilities from 2014 and released new patches for NX-OS, while critical flaws in Zabbix and
Microsoft’s partner portal underscored risks to enterprise environments. Midmonth, Zscaler reported a Zloader variant
linked to Black Basta ransomware, employing Domain Name System (DNS) tunneling for stealthy command and control,
and advanced evasion tactics were seen in a Nova Snake Keylogger variant analyzed by ANY.RUN. Critical vulnerabilities
emerged in Amazon Web Services (AWS) RedShift, Apache deserialization flaws and Progress WhatsUp Gold, affecting
more than 110,000 servers. Meanwhile, Juniper and Citrix appliances faced exploitation via default credentials and
password spraying. And in late December, ransomware and extortion group Cl0p exploited vulnerabilities in Cleo’s file
transfer tools, attacking more than 60 organizations, and threatened to release the full names of the victims unless a
ransom was paid.
