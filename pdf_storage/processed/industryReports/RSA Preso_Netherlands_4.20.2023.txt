Investing Trends
What I’m hearing and seeing
 Seed – a lot of activity; seeing VCs come down market due to lack of later stage deals; SAFEs to bridge
 Early Stage (A & B) valuations down; last round re-opened (flat) or bridge
 Growth  slow, lots of diligence, valuations a proxy of public market multiples
 Flat and Down Rounds
– Effects on founders: dilution
– Effects on investors: potential cram downs due to pay to play provisions (preferred to common)
– Debt will be harder to get and more expensive

2023 Predictions
My thoughts …
 Rebound in M&A Activity in 2H  AI and Cyber will Collide
– Strategics & Sponsors looking for innovation and/or consolidation – Thanks, OpenAI ; SecOps will benefit first – ex., MSFT Security Copilot
– Cyber talent gap will only close w/ AI / automation
 Sustained Growth is the Expectation
– Investors focused on growth as a function of burn and even flirting w/ +EBITDA  Cloud Security Spend
– Currently 1-2% of public cloud spend on security; this percentage will inch up
 Prevalence of Flat & Down Rounds will Increase
another ~1%
– Many companies have failed to grow into their previous valuations
 Shift from Protect to Detect & Respond
 Regulatory Ecosystem Accelerates
– Shift in mentality to one of operational resiliency – they’re already in …
– Data privacy, protection and localization regulations happening at the country
and state (U.S.) levels  Product Led Growth (PLG) Will become more Prevalent
– Software security liability could shift (U.S. Cyber Strategy Pillar III) – Companies will experiment with their GTM to demonstrate faster time to value
to both security practitioners and devs
– AI regulation heating up – not to mention call for pauses on large-scale AI
 More Extortion, Less Ransom; BEC Increases
– Ransomware-as-a-Service has lowered barriers to entry
