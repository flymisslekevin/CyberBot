Our own data, analyzed by Skybox Research Lab

the new reality confronting CISOs and their teams.
The findings reveal not only how vulnerabilities

unprecedented rate, but how threat actors have

Key findings
New vulnerabilities hit an all-time high
There were 20,175 new vulnerabilities published in 2021, up from 18,341 in
2020. That’s the most vulnerabilities ever reported in a single year, and it’s
the biggest year-over-year increase since 2018. The new vulnerabilities add
to a huge cumulative total, making it harder than ever for security teams to
prioritize and remediate issues.
OT vulnerabilities nearly double
Vulnerabilities in operational technology jumped 88%, from 690 in 2020
to 1,295 in 2021. At the same time, OT assets are increasingly connected
to networks, exposing critical infrastructure and other vital systems to
potentially devastating breaches. Attacks on OT systems have risen
precipitously, disrupting operations and even jeopardizing health and safety.
Cryptojacking and ransomware lead new malware production
The malware industry continues to churn out a wide array of malicious
software, particularly cryptojacking and ransomware programs, which
increased by 75% and 42%, respectively. These programs make it easier for
threat actors to mount attacks and turn a quick profit. They demonstrate
how nimbly malware developers respond to new market opportunities and
economic incentives.
Threat actors are exploiting weaknesses faster
The number of new vulnerabilities exploited in the wild rose by 24%. That’s a
sign of just how quickly cybercriminals are now moving to capitalize on new
weaknesses, shrinking the window that security teams have to detect and
address vulnerabilities before an attack.

Attackers and exploits are evolving rapidly
Concurrent with the rise in vulnerabilities, we’re seeing a rapid evolution of the threat landscape as a whole.
Cybercrime has become a vast and thriving industry, with a sprawling ecosystem of specialized goods and
services designed to enable and assist threat actors and all varieties of attack, along with an extensive
infrastructure to facilitate clandestine communication, collaboration, and financial transactions.
