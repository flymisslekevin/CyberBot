Where does the data come from?
RiskRecon is able to offer this analysis based on findings from its cybersecurity ratings and assessment platform. This compliance
report examines the security assessment results for tens of thousands of organizations around the world, and then mapping them to
nine different modern cybersecurity compliance standards:

The mapping is fairly intuitive, since the checks done by RiskRecon’s third-party assessments cover many practices similar to those
stipulated by the regulators. These include security requirements such as enabling email authentication, patching software and servers,
and utilizing effective web encryption.
The caveat is that the data presented here is not as tightly scoped
as an auditor’s assessment. While this is not a full audit of the
tens of thousands of organizations in our dataset, we believe
this to be a reasonable proxy to understand the types of issues FOCUS AREA:

DIGGING INTO THE REALITIES
OF NONCOMPLIANCE
One of the main themes that immediately surfaces from the available data is that nearly every organization struggles with at least some
degree of noncompliance.
The global data in Figure 1 below shows that between 99.4% to 100% (yes, virtually every one[1]) of the tested organizations have at
least one finding that puts their assets at risk of noncompliance across eight of the nine tested regulatory frameworks.

Which Standards Are the Most Difficult
for Organizations to Pass?
While many standards overlap to a varying degree, every standard has a different number of security requirements associated with it.
Our next analysis aims to uncover how the volume of requirements for each standard impacts the rate of noncompliance across our
sample. This can help us gauge which standards are more difficult to achieve.
In Figure 4, we take a look at the percentage of the requirements for each standard that are marked as noncompliant across different
organizations. We see that GDPR is extremely uniform, ISO is largely problematic, while NIST CSF has the lowest amount of relative
noncompliance.

Interestingly, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) indicates

NIST CSF INDICATES THE HIGHEST here. We suspect that’s partly because its requirements are fairly
broad, since it was designed more as a set of control guidelines,

than a prescriptive checklist.
Payment Card Industry Compliance (PCI), Standardized Information Gathering Lite (SIG Lite), Center for Internet Security (CIS), and
SIG Core, all are hovering close together, bringing in the middle ground of compliance. This may indicate that the requirements are
a little more prescriptive and rigid, however, there are guidelines that are relatively attainable. ISO 20071 has the highest percentage
of requirements that are potentially noncompliant, which is not surprising given that this standard requires buy-in and compliance in
almost every single part of a company.
THE STATE OF NONCOMPLIANCE IN CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT RISKRECON.COM 7
WHAT'S IN SCOPE, THOUGH?
With this sort of outside-in visibility, we have to account for the
fact that at least some of the findings will be on low-value assets,
which aren’t in scope for audit. They may not even necessarily put
the organization at risk of lateral movement if other mitigations FOCUS AREA:
such as segmentation are in place. To take the analysis to another
WHEN FOCUSED ON ONLY THE HIGH-VALUE
level we now narrow the lens to focus on high-value assets.
ASSETS, ALMOST EVERY COMPLIANCE
STANDARD HAS A RATE OF NONCOMPLIANT
While we don't know which regulatory standards govern each
organization, nor which of the assets or hosts are in scope for ORGANIZATIONS OF ABOUT 12%
specific compliance mandates, we can make some reasonable
assumptions about business criticality based on what the assets
do. RiskRecon can discover what types of data collected by
assets. When this information includes sensitive data like user
credentials, email addresses, and credit card numbers, the assessment engine categorizes a system as a high value asset. With many
of our standards taking a data-centric approach (cardholder data in the case of PCI, PII in the case of GDPR, etc.), these indicators of
high-value are reasonable proxies to identify the assets that are more likely than others to be in scope.
With that in mind, we turn to look at the percentage of organizations with noncompliant findings on a high-value asset. The numbers
go down, once we consider the criticality of systems. In Figure 5, we focus only on the high value assets. With this lens, almost every
compliance standard has a rate of noncompliant organizations of about 12%. The one exception is NIST CSF, for which that rate goes
down to just over 8%.
Only NIST CSF has a significant proportion of organizations
without compliance findings on high value hosts.
NIST CSF 1.1 8.1%
All other standards 11.7%
Percent of organizations
FIGURE 5: ORGANIZATIONS WITH NONCOMPLIANT FINDINGS ON HIGH-VALUE ASSETS
Lest we get too optimistic about these numbers, let's look at the rate of noncompliance on the assets and hosts themselves. This data
is a little more sobering, as the majority of high-value assets — over 80% — have at least one noncompliant finding on them. NIST CSF
is the exception here as well, with under 20% of high-value assets showing some evidence of noncompliance there.

THOSE THAT DO, THE RATE OF NON- AT LEAST ONE NONCOMPLIANT FINDING
COMPLIANCE IS STILL VERY HIGH.
THE STATE OF NONCOMPLIANCE IN CYBER RISK MANAGEMENT RISKRECON.COM 8
The difference between this chart and Figure 5 indicates that not every organization runs high-value assets, but among those that do,
the rate of noncompliance is still very high. The good news is that the binary indications of noncompliance are not as universal on these
assets as on the entire sample, which means at least some level of attention is being paid to the in-scope assets.
Another variable to consider is that organizations differ in size, with some operating with just a few hosts under their care, and others
running several orders of magnitude more assets. This means, an organization could potentially have a large number of findings, but
it may not be a big deal if those assets are spread out across a lot of hosts. But another organization with a similar number of findings
clustered within fewer hosts could be operating under a much more acute state of noncompliance (and risk!). To normalize the data
a bit, we looked at the data based on the density of noncompliance, in other words, the number of compliance findings on high value
hosts divided by the total number of high value hosts at organization. This provides a better understanding of the scope of the issues.
This gives us the view in Figure 7.

NONCOMPLIANCE VS.
“ACTUAL RISK”
Just as the business criticality of an asset increases the relevance of a noncompliance finding, so does the severity of a flaw, or
weakness, that causes a finding. With that in mind, the next step in our analysis is to examine the noncompliance findings against a
dimension that may provide a better link between compliance and actual security. To describe that lofty goal of actual security, we’ll
use a measure that we’ve used in several previous studies, finding density. Finding density is an organizational metric that takes the
number of important findings found on high value assets, divided by the total number of high value assets at the firm. This provides a
stable measure to compare large enterprises with smaller organizations.
Looking across all standards, the finding density is relatively uniform. The overall density is displayed below in Figure 9.

The security findings discovered in RiskRecon assessments consist of checks of across 40 discrete security criteria that are then grouped
into nine generalized security domains. For example, a test of a security control, like the use of HTTP security headers, is a security
criteria check. That criterion falls into the overarching security domain of Web Application security, which also includes other criteria,
including CMS access control.

APPENDIX: METHODOLOGY
RiskRecon assessments provide a rich profile of the assets and the details of an enterprise’s security configuration and operations.
RiskRecon conducts its assessments with no inside access and no initial knowledge of the enterprise being assessed. RiskRecon
algorithms automatically discover assets and assess their security operations and configuration quality based on publicly accessible
information.
The analysis here is based on anonymized data from thousands of assessments of organizations worldwide. The following figure
displays the common indicators pulled from these assessments and how they were mapped back to the included compliance
standards.
