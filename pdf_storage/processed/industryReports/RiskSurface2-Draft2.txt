"We shall not cease from exploration…
INTRODUCTION and the end of all our exploring
will be to arrive where we started...
and know the place for the first time."
- T.S. Eliot, "Little Gidding"
The world is complex, and ultimate control may be beyond our individual grasp; yet our decisions – what we eat, where we
go, how we do business, and why we turn in one direction instead of another – still matter. In business, choosing to partner
with one company or another is a decision that firms regularly make, and those decisions can have a profound effect on the
risk that the sourcing firm is exposed to.
When managing risk, making binary assumptions, -- either something is good (safe) or bad (unsafe) -- is tempting. To get
on with the business of business and not be paralyzed with perpetual analysis, we have to make informed decisions about
the risks and benefits that a business relationship entails. This must be done by understanding not only the potential
consequences for an organization but also for that organization’s network of vendors, suppliers, customers, and employees.
In this risk surface series, RiskRecon, a Mastercard Company, and Cyentia have worked to help third-party risk managers
understand how to measure and manage risk. We’ve seen variation across industries and other slices. But not all firms are
interchangeable. A payroll processor cannot be replaced with a janitorial supply company, at least not with good business
outcomes! In this report, we look at what distinguishes top-performing firms from those that struggle the most. Armed with
this knowledge, Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) professionals can take into account the totality of their risk surface,
and how it impacts the overall security performance of an organization.
As discovered in our previous report on third party risk management, 1 in 3 programs assess over 100 vendors per year.
And they have good reasons to do so.
We first decided to take a look at the typical number of high-value findings found on high-value hosts. On average, a bottom-
performing organization has 360 times (yes, 36,000%) more high value findings than a typical top-performing partner.

Against this backdrop, throughout this report, we’ll not only define how we identify top and bottom performers in terms of
high risk, but we’ll also dive deeper into what divides the two bookend performers in terms of key performance indicators
that influence their risk surface.

Before we can identify what separates the top and bottom performers, we need to define what “top” and “bottom” mean.
How do we place any given organization in one category or the other? While business performance metrics abound, here
we’re focused solely on how well organizations manage their cybersecurity posture. Our primary measure for well-
performing organizations is the same as used in our Uncertainty to Understanding report, i.e., high-risk findings density.
We used a large sample of data from RiskRecon, filtering it down to

have a high-risk finding density of zero as well as a RiskRecon score of A.
HIGH-RISK FINDINGS DENSITY
In a perfect world, third-party risk managers would be able to accurately and continually assess the expected losses
associated with each vendor in their supply chain using perfect information. Sadly, that is not our reality. What we do have is
a reasonable proxy for organizational cyber risk posture that meets the needs of both this analysis and, more to the point,
risk managers.
While it’s true that firms with strong security defenses can still suffer major losses (and those with weak defenses may,
through luck, squeak by without experiencing any), experience shows that firms that manage risk well perform better over
the long term. Thus, we use the density of high and critical security findings that affect high-value assets as a measurable
proxy for organizational cyber risk posture. This incorporates the following two key dimensions from RiskRecon’s dataset:

This approach is consistently reinforced by our research with RiskRecon. For example, our investigation of Internet of
Things (IoT) devices from 2020, found a jump of 70 times concerning critical security issues in high-value assets between
organizations that expose vulnerable IoT devices to the internet when compared with those that do not. Those organizations
that cannot manage the critical security issues affecting their most valuable assets are almost certainly struggling with
many other aspects of managing their cyber risk posture as well.

Given that we are defining top performers as organizations that have zero findings and a RiskRecon score of A, and we have
identified bottom performers as organizations with the most amount of high-risk finding density, we can take a quick look
at Figure 3 to see the results of this categorization.

comes to the Risk Prioritization

Although security isn’t the only decision criterion that you
should be focused on when selecting third-party providers,
it is an important one. From these matrices alone, there is a
strong case for favoring a top-tier partner over a bottom one.
So, can we get to the root of exactly what it is that makes a
bottom performer act differently from a top performer?

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
When we think about risk, we also have to acknowledge and account for the inherent risk that is posed to your organization
before any mitigation controls. The idea of inherent risk centers around the fact that we often use “common sense” risk
factors to build a risk profile of a company before even undertaking any assessment. For example, if you are working with a
partner that holds critical information, you may find yourself placing them toward the top of your inherent risk ranking, and
pledging to keep a close eye on them.
Throughout this report, we’ll put our inherent risk bias to the test and consider some measurable aspects that might
influence an organization’s risk posture. Why? Because when we look at the measurable things about an organization’s risk
posture, the same can be used to check for a correlation between the key performance indicators and risk surface.
INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION
When assessing the risk of third parties, industry is often considered a major driver of risk posture. Research in the past
shows that making those assumptions isn’t necessarily the most effective thing to do on this front and that the reality is
much more complex.
However, while all industries have findings, some have substantially more than others. In order to take a closer look, we
present Figure 5 which looks at the spread of findings across firms in different industries. This chart shows that while
the median (typical) number of findings often does not vary hugely between the best and the worst groups within an
industry, there is a huge variation in the overall number of findings found in firms.

FIGURE 5: NUMBER OF FINDINGS FOUND IN FIRMS ACROSS INDUSTRIES
Those looking for evidence to support assumption-based claims such as “universities always have poorer security than
NAVIGATING THE INTERNET RISK SURFACE RISKRECON.COM 8
banks” won’t find them here. Instead, we see that the best performers in education are better than the worst performers
in finance. Sure, the education sector as a whole may have the highest (read: worst) median density of high findings, while
finance may appear much better on the list. However, there is a large amount of overlap between the two.
What does this mean? That there is far more variation within industries than
between them. This is important because, typically, third-party risk decisions
are made relative to a particular type of organization within an industry.
The best partner in education might still manage risk better than the worst
partner in finance. When you partner with a top-performing firm, you are more
likely to have fewer findings, regardless of industry.
This tension between the number of findings and the amount of variability
within industries is presented in Figure 6. Looking at the finding density
across industries, we can see how much key industries such as construction
and education stand out from the rest of the pack.
We’ve divided it into four quadrants - less exposed and more variable, less exposed and more consistent, more exposed
and more variable, and more exposed and more consistent. While construction is more exposed to risk, it is also
consistently more variable, whereas education, while consistent, has a much larger risk exposure. When your partners
have more findings and more variability in their findings, you may find yourself in a position where you are taking on more
risk than you may want.

However, following Information over to the bottom performers’ column, we also find that it is ranked 2nd among the
bottom performers. When we follow Finance, we have a bigger drop-off when we look at the bottom performers’ column,
and the data tells us that one in 11 of the bottom performers is in Finance, i.e., a -162.8% change. This reinforces that, on
the whole, Information and Finance industries generally have strong security practices. However, you cannot blindly apply
that across the board to include ALL Information industry partners, since the Information industry also holds the silver
medal amongst the bottom performers.
Education, on the other hand, has a large increase – 247% – in prevalence among the bottom performers. While 1 in 49
firms in the top performers is from the Education sector, Education makes up 1 out of every 14 of the bottom performers.

This could be due to various reasons such as a varying onboarding time for new technologies and risk mitigation
strategies, a larger industry population, or a wider number of technologies that are in play within the industry.
This clearly illustrates the vast range of variability within the industry.
Before we wrap up our look at industry, let’s take a moment to look at Figure 8 to see what impact that choosing a bottom
provider might have on your business.Just by taking a quick look, you can see the immediate impact. When you choose a
bottom provider in Education, you are likely to have 43 times the amount of critical findings than when you partner with a

It’s clear that your partnering decisions do matter, but

differences of opinion on this. Is it easier to keep a smaller
digital footprint tidy or is it that the higher budgets and
resources of larger enterprises give them an advantage?
Buried in the mass of points on the top of Figure 9 is a slight
negative relationship between the number of internet-
facing hosts and the density of high-risk findings.
This implies that more hosts seem to correlate with lower
density, which makes sense: security issues become less
saturated as the digital footprint grows.
The chart on the bottom interjects a “yes, but” into the
conversation. It shows that more hosts generally equate
to more security issues overall. No shock there but this
definitely is something to keep in mind.

Before answering the question that started this section, let’s take a quick look at Figure 10. It offers an interesting view
of industries based on their median density of findings and the median number of assets. The first thing we notice is the
stereotypical separation between the sectors, Education and Finance. In the upper-right, educational institutions struggle
to minimize security issues across a sprawling digital footprint. Whereas, financial institutions, with their regulation-
motivated tight grip on assets, land (on average) on the opposite side.

FIGURE 10: INDUSTRY-LEVEL MEDIAN FINDING DENSITY COMPARED TO MEDIAN NUMBER OF HOSTS
Now, back to the question at hand: Can we use the number of digital assets under management as a quick way to risk-rank
organizations? Figure 11 answers this with a resounding “nope.” The top- and bottom-performing organizations have a
nearly identical distribution of active hosts. And to be honest, that is surprising, especially in light of Figure 8.
We love it when data surprises and corrects our intuition and implicit bias, which sometimes lead to uninformed decisions.
FIGURE 11: COMPARING TYPICAL ACTIVE HOSTS ACROSS TOP AND BOTTOM PERFORMERS
Let’s check one more risk surface dimension before leaving this section: asset value. If the raw number of hosts cannot
differentiate between the top and bottom performers, then perhaps having a high proportion of assets that collect
sensitive information, authenticate users, and run critical services might do the trick2.

What is interesting here is that the proportion of high-value hosts does not seem to be a clear separator of the top and
bottom performers. Not only is there an incredible amount of overlap, but the median is also nearly the same. As with host
count, there is almost no discernible way to conclude that having more or less high-value hosts automatically makes an
organization a top or bottom performer.
GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF HOSTS
The internet is often described as borderless, so it might seem a little odd to take a look at where the hosts are located.
Although the virtual and physical worlds differ in many ways, different parts of the world have different policies, regulations,
and customs that govern the hosts and data. Organizations with larger geographic footprints must manage a larger portfolio
of geopolitical, legal, compliance, and physical risks tied to those geographies. As an indicator of such complexities, we
examine the proportion of hosts located within and outside of a firm’s home country of operation.

FIGURE 13: NUMBER OF COUNTRIES IN WHICH ORGANIZATIONS OPERATE
We see that approximately six out of
10 organizations have their hosts in 10
or fewer countries. This could simply
be due to the size of the organization.
However, whether a potential partner
has hosts strewn across the globe
or consolidated in a single country,
the number of countries the hosts
are located in doesn’t seem to be an
indicator of their security posture.
So, let’s dive a little deeper and look
at the individual host country levels of
high-value hosts against the top and
bottom performers.
FIGURE 14: HOST COUNTRIES WITH TOP PERFORMERS VS. BOTTOM PERFORMERS
To clarify, when talking about host countries, we are looking at the primary country where the majority of a firm’s assets are
located. The top three host countries are virtually the same for both top and bottom performers. 72.2% of top performers
primarily have hosts within the United States, and 67.5% of bottom performers have hosts within the United States. We can
also see that Germany makes up 2.7% of the top performers, but 5.7% of the bottom performers. France nearly doubles its
relative ranking, from 0.9 at the top to 1.6% at the bottom.

Australia (1.1%) France (0.9%)

What you might notice here is that there are certain countries that do not show up on both the lists. Ireland, Switzerland,
and Sweden are only represented in the top performers’ list. Whereas, Japan, Italy, and China are only represented in the
bottom performers’ list.
So what does this actually mean? Are certain countries more or less secure than others? It looks like this can be answered
with a “maybe.” Since the majority of top and bottom performers have hosts located within the United States, United
Kingdom, and Germany, it’s hard to say. However, the fact that certain countries only show up on the bottom performers’
list may have to do more with the organization and upkeep of the hosts and assets than the hosts’ geographic location.
So, if geographic locations do not necessarily show a difference, then let’s look (up) at the next possible host location: the
cloud.
CLOUD, WITH A CHANCE OF FINDINGS
So, let’s first take a look at how organizations are adopting the cloud. Right off the bat, we notice that many industries are
just about to, or very close to, shifting majority cloud, which is an amazing shift in the balance of host locations over the
years. We can also see that the industry bookends of Education and Real Estate, which shows how cloud readiness, along
with their adoption rates, may start to create a clearer picture of what differentiates a top and bottom performer. Again,
this is not to say that the best in Education are not doing better than worst in Real Estate.

First off, we can see that choosing a cloud is way less important
than deciding to go cloud-first.

a cloud-first approach has the largest impact on whether a
partner can be considered a top or bottom performer.
So, if the cloud has such a big impact on determining whether a partner is a top or bottom performer, then does the tech
footprint of an organization also have an impact?
TECH FOOTPRINT
When we talk about the technological footprint of an organization, we are referring to how many different technologies are
in use. We’ll dive into the specific technologies later on, but let’s take a look at whether the sheer number of technologies
used influences what makes a top or bottom performer.

FIGURE 18: NUMBER OF TECHNOLOGIES EMPLOYED ACROSS INDUSTRIES
Education sits high on the list, with the most number of technologies in play, which is no surprise, while Finance,
Professional Services, and Information are at the bottom. Industries like Finance rely heavily on regulated technologies,
processes, and compliance standards to help minimize their risk. So, it comes as no surprise that industries that have a lot
of regulation around them would have a smaller technical footprint. Seeing Energy and Manufacturing high up may, at first
glance, be surprising. However, they have a very wide breadth of organization types and verticals within them, which may
account for the range in the technical footprint size.

FIGURE 19: CONCENTRATION OF TOP 25 TECHNOLOGIES ACROSS INDUSTRIES
The top-25 technologies per industry are pretty impressive, with jQuery heavily favored across the board. However, we can
see some variation in use. For instance, PHP’s largest presence is in Manufacturing and Information, while Ubuntu is being
used primarily in Education. Apache is still being used heavily across the board, i.e., between 74.1 and 90.8%, across all
industries. OpenSSL, on the other hand, shows up as less than a percentage across the board.

When we look at remote access services, the remote desktop protocol has the most instances, while VNC and Webmin
have the least. Recognizing that each technology comes with its pros and cons is part of risk management. Further, it is
important to be warned that you should take a closer look at the technologies that a potential partner utilizes before
making your decision.
There was no time when a top performer had an instance when a bottom performer did not. What this suggests is that it is
not necessarily the size of the technical footprint that matters but what technologies make up the footprint.

Assumptions are usually half-based on fact and partly on a mix of urban
legends, anecdotes, and educated guesses. When trying to assess the
risk surface of an organization, whether it’s yours or someone else’s, it’s
tempting to start by making certain assumptions based on the industry the
organization is in. What we can confidently say is that when you choose to
partner with a top performer, you will be better off. How much better? More
than 300-times better.
Such a large multiple must be backed up with data, so we’ll add one
more chart before closing this report. Figure 23 expands on Figure 1 in
the Introduction. It shows the compounding negative impact of choosing
multiple third parties from among the bottom performers as opposed to
choosing them from among the top performers. There is a clear and large
impact on the business decisions we make, and with every incremental
increase in the number of firms in your supply chain, the impact of choosing
the top or bottom performers will be that much greater.

Whether you are starting to utilize inherent risk rankings or trying to enhance what you currently use for initial vendor
prioritization, examining an organization's technical footprint is a component that can greatly impact how you rank your
vendors. Take the time to go through the technologies that are being used in addition to taking a look at their technological
footprint. How many technologies is this organization not only using but is also responsible for upkeep and monitoring? Are
they using a cloud as a host provider? How many severe findings can be found in those specific technologies?
It’s these questions, rather than looking at the broader lens of industry, that will help you make the most informed decision
around risk. So, while there are several gray zones, and a lot of continuous testing and learning will help you continue to
examine yours, and a partners, organization's risk surface and make the best decisions for yourself.
