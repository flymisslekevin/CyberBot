Achieving Security Resilience
Foreword
When you think of the word resilience, what comes to mind?
I bet you’re thinking of someone or something who has suffered (to
quote the Great Bard) the “slings and arrows of outrageous fortune”
but has the fortitude and audacity to become even stronger.
That’s a perfectly acceptable definition and I applaud the spirit of it.
But when you are talking about securing companies large and small,
merely being resilient enough to bounce back after being down may
not be good enough. After all, successful cybersecurity breaches like
ransomware or intellectual property theft can do outsized harm to
companies, their employees, partners, and even their customers. In
the 2021 Security Outcomes Report, 41 percent of the companies we
surveyed said that they suffered a major security incident or loss within
the last two years, showing how wide this problem has become.
Cisco defines security resilience as being able to protect the
integrity of every aspect of your business so it can withstand,
not just survive, unpredictable threats or changes and emerge
stronger. As you will learn in this third volume of our Security
Outcomes Report, there is near unanimous agreement among
the executives we surveyed that achieving security resilience is
critical to their business. And it’s no wonder as more businesses
are interconnected today, a breach on anyone in the value chain
can have a dramatic ripple effect on the others. No executive
wants to be known as the one not having done enough .
So, please use and enjoy this report. I hope you find it useful
in developing your strategies and solutions for achieving your
measure of security resilience. Resilient to threats. Resilient to
change. Resilient to the unknown. The security industry is certainly
not lacking in buzzwords. However, I have a feeling that the word
resilient is going to stick around for a while. Maybe not as long
as a great Shakespeare play like Hamlet but long enough.

What is security resilience?
Whether or not you consider “resilience” to be a
buzzword, it’s undeniable that it’s on the mind — and
probably on the lips — of many inside and outside the
field of cybersecurity. But what exactly does it mean? We
at Cisco certainly have some thoughts on that topic, but
since this is a survey of 4,700+ security practitioners, we’ll
hand them the mic instead.
When asked to describe what security (or cyber)
resilience means in the context of their organization,
respondents gave a wide range of answers. Yet we do
see some common themes among them.
Words such as “withstand,” “recover,” “anticipate,”
“adapt,” and “adverse” all stand out as core to
the concept of security resilience in the minds of
respondents. If that sounds oddly familiar, it may be
because it’s near verbatim from NIST’s definition of cyber
resilience. That’s perfectly fine; there’s no such thing as
cheating on a survey like this. But it does suggest that the
meaning of resilience is murky enough that many security
professionals had to look it up. We’ll endeavor to make
that concept clearer in the sections that follow.
Cyber resilience:
The ability to anticipate, withstand,
recover from, and adapt to adverse
conditions, stresses, attacks, or
compromises on systems that use

Achieving Security Resilience
Why is security resilience a big deal?

this section title and think, “I’m not
convinced that it is a big deal.”
Fair enough. Since we’re not in the
business of making empty claims,
we’ll back that up right at the start.
We asked respondents about the
level of interest and importance
top executives at their organization
place on security resilience. The
message couldn’t be clearer. A full
96% of executives consider security
resilience highly important . We think
that warrants Really Big Deal status.
Perhaps the high priority placed on
security resilience among executives
stems from the fact that so many
are very well acquainted with
the risks. Nearly two-thirds of
respondents reported suffering

What’s more, the majority of these
events are said to have occurred
within the last two years. From this,
we infer that security resilience is
not just a big deal in the mouths
of thought leaders or the minds
of executives. It’s a concept that’s
critically important to a majority of
organizations around the world.
Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3 8
Achieving Security Resilience
We then asked respondents to elaborate on the types of resilience-impacting
incidents they experienced. As seen in Figure 3, network/data breaches
and network/system outages were both cited by over half of participants
that reported prior incidents. Ransomware and distributed denial-of-service
(DDoS) attacks were the next most common event types, each affecting
about 46% of organizations.
While some of the aforementioned incident types almost certainly involved
employees as a vector of attack (e.g., clicking on a phishing email), overt,
malicious abuse by insiders was reported by about 38% of organizations.
Acts of physical destruction and sabotage were also cited, though
substantially less often than the other incident types.
Figure 3: Types of security incidents that impacted resilience
Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3 9
Achieving Security Resilience
Respondents also had a lot to say about how these events impacted their
organizations (see Figure 4). Over 60% referenced IT and communications
disruptions, as well as the critical role ICT plays in security resilience. Supply
chain disruptions landed in the #2 spot for business-level impacts. We’ve
all been living with that pain lately, so it’s no surprise that organizations are
feeling it too.
While impacts to supply chain operations affect entities outside the victim
organization, impaired internal operations (reported by roughly 41% of firms)
wreak havoc on the inside. Brand damage sits at or near the top of the “what
keeps you up at night” list of many executives, so it’s telling that roughly 40%
of these incidents result in that outcome. Loss of competitive advantage is
another top concern, and it rounds out the top five resilience impacts.
Figure 4: Types of resilience impacts caused by security incidents
What can organizations do to avoid such events and improve security
resilience? Well, that’s one of the main questions we’re seeking to answer
in this report. Right at the outset, it’s clear they’re doing one thing above
all others — spending money. An astounding 96% of participants say their
organizations have increased investments in security in the wake of their
most recent major incident.
Now, we all know throwing money at a problem doesn’t solve it. But we also
know few solutions are free. The important question is which investments give
a return and which do not. We’ll share what we learned about that a bit later.
Before we do, though, let’s explore the primary objectives that fall under the
umbrella of security resilience.

asked a group of security leaders about their goals and objectives for security
resilience. We then reviewed their responses and grouped them into nine
resilience main security resilience outcomes.
Returning to our present global survey, we asked participants which of those
entail? nine key resilience outcomes their organizations considered to be the most
important (they could select up to three). Figure 5 tallies their responses.
Figure 5: Most important security resilience outcomes as selected by participants
We find it somewhat surprising that preventing incidents is the top selection,
given that general consensus seems to place resilience as a “right of boom”
concept. But in combination with mitigating financial losses, the top two picks
target the classic definition of risk — probability and impact.
Next up, adapting to unexpected events calls back to themes depicted in
the free-form responses shared earlier. We can’t help wondering if recent
experience with the COVID-19 pandemic pushed that one up the list.
We’ll refrain from commenting on all nine outcomes and instead skip down
to the last one. Recruiting and retaining security talent was only seen as
a primary aspect of security resilience by 3.8% of respondents. Perhaps
respondents see talent retention as HR’s responsibility or a long-term
objective rather than critical to a resilience-impacting event. But ample and
trained security staff are a critical success factor for resilient organizations, as
we’ll elaborate on later.
Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3 12
Achieving Security Resilience
As you might imagine, experience shapes one’s perception of what security
resilience entails. Recall earlier when we said that 62% of respondents
experienced a resilience-impacting security incident. According to Figure 6,
those events may have triggered a reordering of priorities.
Figure 6: Ranking of

Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3 13
Achieving Security Resilience
Mitigating losses moves from #4 among organizations without major incidents
to #1 for those who’ve lived through them. Adapting to change events and
keeping up with the business bump up as well. Preventing incidents and
capability maturity take a backseat.
You may also be wondering if perceptions of security resilience differ
based on demographic and firmographic characteristics. Here again the data
answers in the affirmative. We’ll use the respondent’s role as the filter for this
one to compare CISOs and Security Directors with security professionals in
technical roles.
Figure 7: Ranking of
perceived importance
of security resilience
outcomes by work role
Differences in opinion emerge right from the start. Security leaders prioritize
mitigating financial losses, containing the spread and scope of events, and not
hindering the business. More technical and operational security respondents
rank those 2nd, 5th, and 6th, respectively and place the highest importance
on preventing major incidents. That’s not to say either group is right or wrong;
it’s natural that they focus on different aspects of security resilience. But it’s
probably a good idea to establish shared priorities and delineate responsibilities
to ensure everyone works as a team to achieve better outcomes.

The state of security resilience
We asked respondents how confident they were that Figure 8: Confidence in ability to remain resilient through a
worst-case cyber event
their organization would remain resilient through a worst-
case (but still plausible) cyber event if it occurred today.
A little over a third expressed strong confidence, with
the remaining two-thirds expressing some level of doubt
about how their organizations would fare.
Asking a subjective question like that is an interesting gut
check on the state of security resilience, but we’ll need to
be more specific and measured if we want to accomplish
our goals. Since we have input from respondents on a set
of desired security resilience outcomes, let’s see where
organizations stand in terms of achieving those outcomes.
We asked respondents to rate their organization’s
performance for each objective using a four-point scale
(failing | struggling | performing | excelling). To help
them do that more objectively, we provided a description
of each outcome along with example evidences of
what failure and/or excellence might look like. These
descriptions and examples are included in Appendix B for
those curious about the details or interested in adapting
these for use within your own organization.
Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3 16
Achieving Security Resilience
In general, the majority of respondents gave their organizations at least a
“performing” rating overall. But don’t take that to mean all is hunky dory
in the world of security resilience. As seen in Figure 9, almost half of the
survey participants say their organizations are struggling or outright failing to
achieve at least one of the nine security resilience outcomes. Over a quarter
are having difficulty with two or more, 10% report at least four outcomes
giving them trouble, and so on. From that, we conclude that there are a lot of
organizations out there underachieving in key areas of security resilience.
Figure 9: Proportion of organizations struggling with security resilience outcomes
Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3 17
Achieving Security Resilience
We saw earlier that perceptions vary on the relative importance of these
security resilience outcomes, so it’s no real shock to learn that performance
varies as well for different types of organizations. Take Figure 10, for example,
where we compare the proportion of participants struggling with each outcome
across different organization sizes. Firms of all sizes agree that recruiting and
retaining security staff is the biggest challenge, but the consensus ends there.
We find this view particularly interesting because it gives the sense that areas
of struggle change as organizations grow. For instance, mitigating financial
losses is purportedly least challenging for the smallest firms. (Maybe because
they’re more worried about going out of business than losing money?) But it
creeps successively up into the top three for organizations with 1,000–9,999
employees. And then it crashes back to last place for the largest enterprises.
(Maybe because they have extra financial security from high revenues?)
On the other hand, some things seem to never change with growth. As
mentioned above, organizations of all sizes apparently struggle more to recruit
and retain security talent than with any other outcome. That’s rather ironic since
they also unanimously rate that outcome as the lowest priority for security
resilience. A self-fulfilling prophecy, perhaps? Or maybe just blunt pragmatism.
(“Sure, it’s hard to keep good people, but I’m far more concerned about
avoiding major incidents and losses.”)
Figure 10: Most challenging security resilience outcomes ranked by organization size
Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3 18
Achieving Security Resilience
In addition to assessing performance for individual outcomes, we wanted
an overall measure of security resilience for each participating organization.
So we created a security resilience score based on each organization’s
achievement across all nine outcomes. If you’d like to know how we did that,
check out the callout below. But the gist is that a higher score means higher
performance across greater numbers of security resilience outcomes. We
will use this score extensively in the next section to measure the efficacy of
various success factors in improving security resilience.

support
Our data suggests that security programs that are tightly aligned with the core
mission of the business have stronger executive-level support and improved
resilience to boot (+32% to overall score). Thus, bridges to the C-suite are
built upon a solid understanding of how the business works and how security
initiatives can make it work even better. Support goes both ways in any
relationship, after all.
While on the topic of relationships, we’ll mention another observation from
our analysis. We asked respondents where the responsibility for security
resilience sits in their org chart. And for the most part, reporting lines don’t
seem to make a big difference. But we did notice that organizations in which
the CEO, CRO (Chief Risk Officer), and CISO were closely involved had
significantly higher security resilience scores than those where the buck
stopped with other C-level executives (e.g., CIO, COO, CTO, CFO).

That is, of course, much easier said than done. And it’s a fair question to ask
what is meant by a strong security culture and how that was assessed in our
report. We provided the following guidance to respondents to help them assess
and rate the strength of their organization’s security culture:
In a strong security culture, employees are treated as part of the solution
rather than the problem. Security staff understand their role in the context
of the organization and non-security staff know they have a role to play
too. This may be seen by regularly reporting phishing attempts, potential
malware, and other incidents. Security isn’t a negative theme in employee
satisfaction surveys or exit interviews. Conversely, frequent security policy
violations and workarounds are evidence of poor security culture.
That’s not intended to be an exhaustive description of what a strong security
culture looks like because it will look different in every organization. But it at
least level sets what respondents had in mind when they rated the strength of
their security culture, and hopefully sparks ideas for measuring your own.
Reading between the lines of that description, you may get the sense that
it’s important for a security program to clearly communicate its policies
and rationale with the rest of the organization. Respondents giving their
organizations high marks on that front showed a 27% increase in security
resilience scores over those who said their security programs can’t articulate
what they’re doing and why they’re doing it. It’s hard to build a strong culture
when everyone’s using a different set of blueprints.

in reserve
Surprisingly, we did not find a strong correlation between the overall size
of security staff and level of security resilience, even when controlling for
total number of employees in the organization. What does appear to make a
difference, though, is maintaining excess internal staff and resources in order
to better respond to unexpected cyber events. Organizations able to do that
achieve 15% higher security resilience scores on average than those without
“flex” resources to tap into when needed.
How exactly do organizations maintain excess internal resources when it’s already
difficult to hire and retain baseline security staffing? Unfortunately, we didn’t ask
for those details in the survey but it’s now on the list for future research.

If maintaining excess internal staff to handle unexpected events isn’t feasible
for your organization, all is not lost. Our analysis also points to an 11% average
improvement in security resilience among firms that retain external incident
response (IR) services. Consider getting those retainer contracts in place with a
credible IR service provider so help is just a phone call away.
You may be thinking that if extra internal resources or external IR services each
offer benefits, then perhaps they’re even better together. That indeed appears
to be the case. Having both internal and external resources ready to go in a
major cyber event gives another 13% bump to security resilience scores over
having just one or the other.

We asked participants if, in general, their IT infrastructure was hosted
on-premises or in the cloud (or varying levels of hybrid models). Then we
correlated those answers with each organization’s security resilience score.
Cloud-heavy organizations averaged 526, while those predominately
on-premises averaged 525. In other words, we see no difference in
security resilience outcomes between heavy on-premises versus heavy
cloud environments.

cloud a little less of a doozie. Organizations that, in a separate question, rated
their hybrid environment as easier to manage and secure appear to cushion
the negative hit to resilience that typifies the early phases of cloud migration.
Their resilience scores dropped by just 8.5% rather than 14%. What’s more,
the benefits of simplified management of hybrid environments grow along with
greater levels of cloud adoption.
Organizations with more extensive hybrid environments exhibit resilience scores
that are statistically on par with the on-premises (or fully cloud) baseline —
provided they’re able to simplify management. If not, those resilience gains
are erased as the organization languishes in that hard-to-manage hybrid
state. Overall, there’s a 15% difference in resilience scores between early
hybrid cloud environments that are difficult to manage and advanced cloud
deployments that are simpler to manage.
Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3 26
Achieving Security Resilience
Figure 14: Effect of cloud adoption and ease of management on security resilience
From that, we infer that keeping things simple and friction free is a key success
factor for transitioning to the cloud. Since hybrid cloud deployments are a
necessary part of that journey, ensuring you have the right tools and services
in place to manage these complex environments will help your organization
remain secure and resilient throughout the journey.
It’s worth noting that the general pattern described here applies to organizations
of all sizes. There’s not much measurable difference in security resilience
between the cloud vs. on-premises extremes for any sized organization. But
both SMBs and large enterprises alike struggle with resilience in hybrid cloud
infrastructures. One difference we did note is that larger organizations are three
times as likely to rate their environment as complex and difficult to manage,
meaning their move to the cloud could translate into a bigger hit to security
resilience if not managed well.

security must exist everywhere to fully protect the business. Traditional security
approaches that trust anything (devices, users, infrastructure, etc.) inside the
zero trust
corporate network can’t deliver that level of protection. Thus, an approach that
eliminates blind trust has arisen. A zero trust model establishes trust in users
adoption and devices through authentication and continuous monitoring of each access
attempt, with custom security policies that protect every application.
The obvious question, then, is whether we see any evidence that a zero
trust model improves security resilience. And to that question, we’re glad
to respond with a definitive “yes.” Respondents with mature zero trust
implementations boosted their security resilience rating by 30% over
organizations that haven’t started that journey! Furthermore, zero trust
correlated with significantly higher success rates for 8 out of the 9 security
resilience outcomes we discussed earlier.
± 30 % difference in average resilience scores
between organizations with non-existent
and mature zero trust implementations
A mature zero trust implementation doesn’t happen overnight, nor are the full
benefits to resilience reaped all at once. It’s a journey. We don’t have the space
in this report to draw up a detailed map of that journey, but we do have a ton
of resources to help those interested in getting started. What we will do is
highlight some key steps to demonstrate the progressive benefits of maturing
zero trust adoption.
The first step of the zero trust journey for many organizations is verifying users
and devices through multi-factor authentication (MFA). Among our respondents,
rolling out MFA correlates with an 11% improvement in security resilience scores.
Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3 29
Achieving Security Resilience
Many organizations continuing their zero trust journey will also implement
continuous validation of users and devices along with micro-segmentation
of workloads. According to our data, those that do add another 6% to their
security resilience score. Don’t dismiss those gains, and remember that large
percentage increases get harder as base scores get higher.
Figure 15: Effect of zero trust implementation milestones on security resilience
Let’s look at one more milestone on the zero trust journey, this one nearing
the finish line. Here, organizations have bolstered MFA, continuous validation,
and micro-segmentation with adaptive policies, extensive monitoring, and
orchestration of user workflows. That brings us to what we labeled as a
“mature” implementation of zero trust to achieve the full 30% improvement in
security resilience scores referenced above.
Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3 30
Achieving Security Resilience
“At the end of the day, zero trust is a
philosophy that can be applied to any
technology . Technology by itself is not
enough and every organization’s journey will
take a different route to their destination of
choice . Finding the right mix of technologies
to implement its core principles is what will
ultimately unlock the full benefits of zero trust
security for a more resilient business .”

sense that modern cyber threats come at you from a multitude of vectors.
But if you’re a skeptic and need more convincing, you can dive headlong into
detection and
the hundreds of adversary techniques and sub-techniques listed in the MITRE
ATT&CK framework. The point is that all of these tactics and techniques require
response multiple vantage points in order to detect and respond to them effectively.
Extended detection and response (XDR) delivers visibility into data across
capabilities networks, clouds, endpoints, and applications while applying analytics and
automation to detect, analyze, hunt for, and remediate today’s and tomorrow’s
threats. You can probably guess where this is headed. Do we see measurable
improvements to security resilience as detection and response capabilities
extend to cover more threat vectors and enterprise assets? Let’s find out.
± 45 % difference in average resilience scores
between organizations with non-existent
versus mature XDR implementations
To test that, we’ll establish a baseline for organizations that haven’t made
progress with XDR or even its predecessor, endpoint detection and response
(EDR). The security resilience scores of those organizations average 393. To put
that in perspective, this puts them in the 14th percentile for security resilience
among all participants. Obviously not where most want to stay.
Since many view EDR as a foundational component of XDR, we’ll consider that
milestone #1 on the journey. Organizations that report rolling out EDR upped
their overall security resilience score by 23% over the baseline. Not bad at all.
But also not really XDR, so let’s keep going.
Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3 32
Achieving Security Resilience
Participants that report having the basic elements of XDR in place add another
10 percentage points to their security resilience score, rising 33% higher than
organizations with no EDR or XDR deployments. By “basic,” we mean that they
have detection and response capabilities at the endpoint and network but
haven’t yet integrated it all together.
Figure 16: Effect of XDR implementation milestones on security resilience
Extending capabilities is great, but anyone who’s worked in security operations
knows the challenges that come with wider and deeper visibility. The ever-
increasing volume of events that must be triaged and responded to is what
leads to many security incidents that we read about in those headlines. In our
view, there are two major things that integrate the base components of XDR
into a cohesive solution: cyber threat intelligence and automation/orchestration.
Detection and response capabilities work best when they know what to
look for and how to find it. Many look to quality cyber threat intelligence
for that purpose. Security automation and orchestration is the connective
tissue of mature XDR implementations. Together, they take XDR to the next
level. Organizations with all of these capabilities significantly improved their
performance in all nine resilience outcomes and boasted a 45% better overall
resilience score than those with no progress toward XDR.

fragmented and exposed.
Secure access service edge (SASE) offers a strategy to converge networking
and security into a cloud-delivered service, simplify operations, and remain
resilient in the face of ever-changing business demands. Do we have evidence
from our report that SASE does indeed correlate with improved resilience? Yes!
± 27 % difference in average resilience scores
between organizations with non-existent
versus more mature SASE implementations
We didn’t get into the specifics of classic components of SASE implementation
(see Gartner’s definition), but we did inquire about participants’ general
progress in that direction. Organizations claiming to have SASE deployments
exhibit overall security resilience scores that are, on average, 15% higher than
those that have no plans or progress on the SASE front. We also found that
SASE implementation correlates with higher success rates for eight out of the
nine individual security resilience outcomes.
Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3 34
Achieving Security Resilience
But wait, there’s more! Cisco expands on Gartner’s definition of SASE to
include advanced threat detection and response capabilities, among other
components. Since we did ask about those capabilities, we were curious to see
if organizations that incorporated them along with their SASE implementations
were even more resilient. Turns out they did indeed climb to new heights of
security resilience, raising their scores to 27% higher than the baseline of
organizations that haven’t started rolling out SASE.

Anywhere you see a blue square means the intersecting NIST capability
and security resilience outcome have a statistically significant correlation.
The percentages within those blue squares denote the increased likelihood
of successfully achieving that outcome among organizations with the most
effective implementations of that capability. In other words, participants that
do a great job tracking key systems and data are almost 11% more likely
to excel at containing the spread and scope of security incidents (top left

to improve specific resilience outcomes, then pick one along the lefthand side
and scan across to find data-backed options for accomplishing that. If, on

Appendix B:
Security resilience outcomes
1 . Containing the spread or scope of security incidents: When security
incidents do occur, their scope is contained by controls and processes
that limit lateral movement, privilege escalation, dwell time, propagation
to other departments, etc. A track record of keeping incidents in check
that might otherwise have been much bigger or recent tests that
validate these capabilities would be an indicator of success here.
2 . Mitigating financial losses stemming from security incidents: When
security incidents do occur, their cost is reduced through controls and
processes that mitigate their extent of impact and associated losses.
Examples include plans and procedures to recover quickly, limit brand
damage, reduce downstream losses to other parties, avoid litigation,
transfer risk through cyber insurance, etc. Hoping for the best or a
strategy of “we’ll deal with what may come” would be a sign of struggle.
3 . Adapting to unexpected external change events or trends: The security
program is agile and able to respond effectively to changing conditions
triggered by unforeseen and uncontrollable events outside the organization.
Adapting well to the sudden transition to a remote workforce during the
COVID-19 pandemic and handling the subsequent trends of hybrid work
and quickening digital transformation would be evidence of success.
4 . Keeping up with the demands and growth of the business: The
security program responds well to changing business needs and
doesn’t impede new lines of revenue. In some cases, security may
provide competitive advantage or even be a net revenue generator. If
security is viewed as a business roadblock or purely as a cost center
by business execs, it’s a sign of struggling to meet this goal.
5 . Continuing to mature and improve security capabilities: The
security program establishes goals, tracks progress, and seeks to
continually improve its efficacy over time. The program may not
yet be mature in all areas but should know where it most needs to
improve and have a plan to get there. A stagnant security program
that’s falling behind modern threats or a philosophy of being “done”
after the next control is implemented would be signs of struggle.
Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3 43
Achieving Security Resilience
6 . Preventing major cybersecurity incidents and losses: We expect that an
organization that’s highly successful in achieving this goal has not had a
serious or highly impactful security incident (high internal and/or external
visibility) in the last couple years. Furthermore, there’s no reason to suspect
that it’s merely a matter of time until a major loss event occurs. Minor and
even moderate incidents are expected, but the question here is whether
the organization has and will continue to stay out of the headlines.
7 . Ensuring business continuity through disruptive events: System
failures, network outages, and other technology disruptions have
minimal impact on critical business operations. The organization is
able to successfully navigate sudden and unexpected events that
force extensive or rapid architectural and/or process changes.
8 . Maintaining a cost-effective security program: Executive leaders
view the security program as having good ROI. No recurring
rumblings about the overly high costs of security. Low rate of
shelfware purchases. Staffing is lean yet not starved. A plan among
executives and security leaders to reduce the security budget
without increasing risk would be a good sign of success here.
9 . Recruiting and retaining talented security personnel: The organization
has a positive reputation in the security community as being a good
place to work. Open security positions are generally filled quickly and
without undue incentives. Talented staff move up instead of move out
and attrition rates remain low. Employee satisfaction is consistently high.
