Introduction
Sophos' annual study of the real-world ransomware experiences of IT professionals
working at the frontline has revealed an ever more challenging attack environment 5,600
together with the growing financial and operational burden ransomware places
respondents
on its victims. It also shines new light on the relationship between ransomware
and cyber insurance, and the role insurance is playing in driving changes to cyber
defenses. 31

About the survey
100-5,000
Sophos commissioned research agency Vanson Bourne to conduct an independent,
vendor-agnostic survey of 5,600 IT professionals in mid-sized organizations employee organizations
(100-5,000 employees) across 31 countries. The survey was conducted during
January and February 2022, and respondents were asked to respond based on their
Jan/Feb 2022
experiences over the previous year.

Attacks are up and their complexity and
impact are increasing
66% of organizations were hit by ransomware in the last year, up from 37% in 2020.
This is a 78% increase over the course of a year, demonstrating that adversaries
66%
have become considerably more capable at executing the most significant attacks
at scale. This likely also reflects the growing success of the Ransomware-as-a- hit by ransomware in the last year
Service model which significantly extends the reach of ransomware by reducing the
skill level required to deploy an attack. [Note: hit by ransomware was defined as one
or more devices impacted by the attack but not necessarily encrypted.]
Adversaries have also become more successful at encrypting data in their attacks. 65%
In 2021 attackers succeeded in encrypting data in 65% of attacks, an increase on
attacks resulted in data encryption
the 54% encryption rate reported in 2020. However, there was a reduction from 7%
to 4% in the percentage of victims that experienced an extortion-only attack where
data was not encrypted but the organization was held to ransom with the threat of
exposing data.

from 96% last year.
Backups are the #1 method used to restore data, used by 73% of organizations
whose data was encrypted. At the same time, 46% reported that they paid the
ransom to restore data. These numbers reflect the fact that many organizations use
multiple restoration approaches to maximize the speed and efficacy with which they
can get back up and running. Overall, almost half (44%) of the respondents whose
organization’s data had been encrypted used multiple methods to restore data.
While paying the ransom almost always gets you some data back, the percentage of

data restored after paying has dropped. On average, organizations that paid got back
only 61% of their data, down from 65% in 2020. Similarly, only 4% of those that paid 61% paid the

Ransom payments have increased
965 respondents whose organization paid the ransom shared the exact amount,
revealing that average ransom payments have increased considerably over the last year. 3x
increase in proportion that paid
Over the last year there has been an almost threefold increase in the proportion of ransoms of US$ 1M or more
victims paying ransoms of US$1 million or more: up from 4% in 2020 to 11% in 2021. In
parallel, the percentage paying less than US$10,000 dropped from one in three (34%) in
2020 to one in five (21%) in 2021.
Overall, the average ransom payment came in at US$812,360, a 4.8X increase from 21%
the 2020 average of US$170K (based on 282 respondents). While this headline sum is
paid ransoms of less than $10,000
influenced by 15 eight-digit payments, it’s clear from the data that ransoms are trending
upwards across the board. There is considerable industry variation, with adversaries
extracting the highest sums from those they consider most able to pay:
Ì HIGHEST average ransom payments were US$2.04M in manufacturing and $812,360
production (n=38) and US$2.03M in energy, oil/gas and utilities (n=91)
average ransom payment
Ì LOWEST average ransom payments were US$197K in healthcare (excluding outliers)
(n=83) and US$214K in local/state government (n=20)
In Italy, where extortion payments are illegal, meaning organizations are not allowed
by law to pay the ransom, 43% of those whose data was encrypted admit that their

Ransomware has a major commercial and
operational impact
The ransom sums are just part of the story, and the impact of ransomware ranges
much more widely than just the encrypted databases and devices. 90% of those hit 90%
by ransomware in the last year said the most significant attack impacted their ability

to operate. Furthermore, among private sector organizations, 86% said it caused
their ability to operate
them to lose business/revenue.
Overall, the average cost to an organization to rectify the impact of the most recent
ransomware attack in 2021 was US$1.4M. This welcome drop from US$1.85M 86%
in 2020 likely reflects that, as ransomware has become more prevalent, the

It's worth noting that in many cases the where the ransom is paid, the insurance
provider, rather than the victim, foots the bill. We cover this in more detail later in the $1.4M average cost to
report. remediate an attack
On average, organizations that suffered attacks in the last year took one month to
recover from the most significant attack – a long time for most companies. The
slowest recovery was reported by higher education and central/federal government

where around two in five took over one month to recover. In contrast, the fastest average time to recover
sectors were manufacturing and production (10% took over one month) and MONTH from an attack
financial services (12% took over one month), likely a result of the high levels of
recovery planning and preparation.
Furthermore, some organizations continue to put their faith in ineffective defenses.

Ransomware drives cyber insurance cover
Over four in five mid-sized organizations have cyber insurance against ransomware.
However, while 83% of respondents say their organization has cyber insurance that
covers them if hit by ransomware, 34% say there are exclusions/exceptions in their
83%
policy. Energy, oil/gas, and utilities are most likely to have coverage (89%) closely
followed by retail (88%). Cyber insurance adoption increases with organization size, have cyber insurance
with 88% of 3,001-5,000 employee organizations having cover compared to 73% against ransomware
those with 100-250 employees.
Organizations hit by ransomware in the last year are much more likely to have cyber
insurance than those that avoided falling victim to an attack. Among those that were
89%
hit, 89% have cyber insurance compared with 70% of those not hit. The cause and
effect is not clear here. It may be that direct experience of a ransomware incident hit by ransomware have
has driven many organizations to take insurance to help mitigate the impact of cyber insurance
future attacks. Alternatively, adversaries may target their attacks on organizations
that they know have insurance cover to increase their chances of a ransom pay out.
Another option is that some organizations took cover to balance known weaknesses
in their defenses. The reality is likely a combination of all three. 70%
Cyber insurance cover drops to 61% among those that were not hit and don’t not hit by ransomware have
expect to experience an attack. Given that many in this group are putting faith in cyber insurance
approaches that don’t stop ransomware, lack of cover leaves them fully exposed to
the costs of an incident.

94% of those with cyber insurance said the process for securing coverage had
changed over the last year. 94%
Ì 54% say the level of cybersecurity they need to qualify is now higher have found it harder to secure cyber

Given that the major cyber insurance price rises began in the second and third changes to their defenses to improve
quarters of 2021, it’s likely that many of the respondents hadn’t experienced the their cyber insurance position
impact of this change at the time of the research.
As the cyber insurance market hardens and it becomes more challenging to secure
cover, 97% of organizations that have cyber insurance have made changes to their
cyber defense to improve their cyber insurance position. 64% have implemented
new technologies/services, 56% have increased staff training/education activities,
and 52% have changed processes/behaviors.

Cyber insurance pays out in almost all
ransomware claims
Reassuringly for those with cyber insurance cover, 98% that were hit by ransomware
and had cyber insurance that covered ransomware said the policy paid out in the 98%
most significant attack – up from 95% in 2019. In a number of countries this rose
pay-out rate on ransomware claims
to a full 100% pay out rate: Switzerland (n=52), Mexico (n=131), Sweden (n=68),
Belgium (n=66), Poland (n=75), Turkey (n=51), UAE (n=49), India (n=218) and
Singapore (n=91).
Looking at what the cyber insurance cover paid for, the survey reveals an increase in
Clean-up Cost Payout
the payment of cleanup costs and a decrease in ransom payments by insurers. 77%
of respondents reported that their insurer paid cleanup costs i.e., costs incurred to
get the organization up and running again – up from 67% in 2019. Conversely, 40% 67% 77%
reported that the insurer paid the ransom, down from 44% in 2019.
2019 2021
However, the rate of ransom payout rates varied considerably by sector. The highest
rates were reported in lower education (K-12/primary/secondary) (53%), state/
local government (49%), and healthcare (47%), and the lowest in manufacturing

and production (30%) and financial services (32%). It’s interesting to note that the
sectors with the lowest rate of ransom payment are also the ones able to recover
fastest from an incident, emphasising the importance of disaster recovery planning

and preparation.
2019 2021
It's worth remembering that while cyber insurance will help get you back to your
previous state, it doesn’t cover ‘betterment’ i.e., when you need to invest in better
technologies and services to address weaknesses that led to the attack.
