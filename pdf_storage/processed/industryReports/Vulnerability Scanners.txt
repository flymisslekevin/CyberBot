ABSTRACT
With the increasing concern for security in the network, many approaches are laid out that try to protect
the network from unauthorised access. New methods have been adopted in order to find the potential
discrepancies that may damage the network. Most commonly used approach is the vulnerability
assessment. By vulnerability, we mean, the potential flaws in the system that make it prone to the attack.
Assessment of these system vulnerabilities provide a means to identify and develop new strategies so as to
protect the system from the risk of being damaged. This paperfocuses onthe usage of various vulnerability
scanners and their related methodology to detect the various vulnerabilities available in the web
applications or the remote host across the network and tries to identify new mechanisms that can be
deployed to secure the network.

1.INTRODUCTION
With the emergence of information technology, the security aspect of the users has become a
more concerned factor. Since most of the software developers are not aware of various security
measures to beintroduced into the system as their motive isjusttomake the software application
run in a desired state without taking into consideration the flaws that the programming language
might have introduced into the system; to protect the users from the risk of being attacked by any
unauthorised access, it becomes significantly more important to devise new strategies and
methodologies that will consider the security breaches to which the user is prone to. Not only the
software developed with flaws makes the user vulnerable to attacks, most often network also
becomes a key factor by compromising the security aspectof theusers.
Assessing and eliminating the vulnerabilities requires the knowledge and deep understanding of
these vulnerabilities.It becomes necessary enough to know the basic idea that works behind these
vulnerabilities such as what makes them to appear in the system, what flaws need to be corrected
to make the system free from these vulnerabilities, what alternatives can be further devised for
these vulnerabilities so that in future, their risk can be reduced and many more.
Various methods have been deployed to identify these vulnerabilities and appropriate steps are
taken. Strategies such as static analysis, attack graph generation and its analysis, usage of
vulnerability scanners are some of them. However, the use of vulnerability scanners to detect the
vulnerabilities is quite prominent today. They play a significant role in the generation of attack
graphs.

Our work involves study of various port scanners and vulnerability scanners, scanning of various
online web applications and remote host using these scanners. We analysed various
vulnerabilities and make a comparison of various scanners based on their capability to identify
these vulnerabilities.
Section 2 explains various techniques developed before the usage of vulnerability scanners.
Section 3 describes various vulnerability scanners in detail with the results, when applied on
various websites.Comparative study of various scanners is given in Section 4.
2.TECHNIQUESFORVULNERABILITYSCANNING
2.1STATIC ANALYSIS
Static analysis is a fast and reliable technique. It has been considered as an efficient method in
detecting the vulnerabilities[3].This technique focuses on the analysis of program structure using
various means. It emphasizes on the analysis of the code of the program in order to detect the
flaws present in it.
Some of the techniques included in static analysis are lexical analysis, type inference, constraint
analysis and many more. Lexical analysis focuses on the semantics of the program structure; the
program structure is divided into modules and then each module is compared with the loophole
libraryin order to detect any flaws present in the system. Type inference is related to the data type
rules for the variable. It determines whether the variables used in the program are in sync with the
type to which they relate. Constraint analysis is a two-step process. It involves- constraint
generation and constraintsolution [1].
Manytools based on the techniquesmentioned above aredeveloped. The first tooldeveloped was
FlexeLint. It uses pattern matching algorithm to detect flaws. Other tools developed are ITS4,
SPLINT, UNO, FindBugs, Checkstyle, ESC/Java, and PMD. ITS4, Checkstyle and PMD are
based on lexical analysis; SPLINT is based on rule checking; UNO is based on model checking;
ESC/Java is based on theorem proving and FindBugs is based on both lexical and dataflow
analysis[1].
These tools have been evaluated by analysing their performance in terms of false positives and
false negatives. Many of them have low false positives, some produce accurate results and many
witnessed high false negatives. Hence, static analysis techniques have many demerits associated
with them. For instance, a loophole library or database is maintained which is used to validate the
vulnerabilities found in the program; however if an unknown vulnerability is detected, then it is
not possible to compare it with the predefined loophole library for its validation [1].
Thus, to resolve the deficiencies associated with the static analysis, an approach was suggested
that involved combining the dynamic detection strategy with staticanalysis.
2.2 ATTACKGRAPH ANALYSIS
Attack graph is defined as the succinct representation of all the paths followed by an attacker in a
network to achieve its desired state. The desired state may involve damaging the network,
stealing the network packets or gaining a complete access over it to determine what is going in
the network.

Network security is a key aspect of security concern and many ways have been identified to
protect it. The recent approach that has been included is the use of attack graphs. Attack graph has
become the most widely used approach with reference to network security.
Attack graphs help to determine the security weaknesses that lie in the network. System
administrators use it to analyze the network for its weaknesses that may allow an attacker to
exploit it and gain control over the network [2]. Attack graphs are usually large enough as they
represent the complete network with its underlying weaknesses, hence they are quite complex to
understand and analyse. Both the generation and analysis of attack graph are significant for
protectingthe network from security breaches.
The most common approach to generate an attack graph requires the analysis of vulnerabilities
that lie in the network and then using an attack graph generator, attack graphs can be generated
[4]. The vulnerabilities could be identified with the help of various vulnerability scanners that are
designed for this purpose only. Specifically, Nessus is extensively used for the identification of
the underlying vulnerabilities.
Various other techniques have already been proposed for generating an attack graph as well as for
their analysis. For instance, adjacency matrix clustering algorithm makes the complex attack
graph simpler enough. It combines the blocks having similar attack graph pattern. The matrix
represents the attack reachability within one step. For multiple steps, matrix is raised to a higher
power level[13].
Ranking algorithm is another approach, based on the rank of the attack graphs. The rank decides
the priority of an attack graph that is more applicable to attacker [14]. Another approach is a
game theoretic approach where the attacker and network administrator are considered as two
players and a Nash equilibrium is applied that gives the administrator an idea of attacker’s
strategy and helps him to plan to do something in order to protect the network[12].
Table 1 above compares the various attack graph generation and analysis techniques and
illustrates the advantages and disadvantages of each [2].

3.VULNERABILITYSCANNERS
A large number of applications are becoming online,but how secure are these products is a matter
of concern as it is related to the user’s security who will beultimately using the application. Thus,
it becomes necessary to find out vulnerabilitiespresent in the software application that may cause
a severe risk to the user’s security [5].
Vulnerability assessment meansidentifyingthe vulnerabilities in the systembefore they could be
used by anyone else with bad intentions of harming the network. This is a proactive approach
where the vulnerability is foundand is dealt with accordingly before anyone comes to know about
it. More emphasis has always been laid on the firewall protection but the internal functionality
does matter. Vulnerability assessment is not only performed on a particular application but it even
correlates the platform on which the application is being run, middleware, operating system being
used etc. It takes into consideration all the factors that can provide the correct answer for the
assessment of the vulnerability and security of the system. Therefore, vulnerability scanners are
used to scan the network system and/or the softwareapplications.
Scanning can be of two types:
a) Passive Scanning: In passive scanning, it is determined whether a tool can enlist the
vulnerabilities by considering the existing network.
b) Active Scanning: In active scanning, it is determined whether the queries can be made to
the network for the vulnerability.
Different categories of scanner are:
a) Port Scanners: Port scanners are used to scan the ports for determining the open and
closed ports, operating system, services offered.
b) Application Scanners: Application scanners are used to assess a specific application on
the network in order to track its weaknesses that can be further used to cause the risk to
the system.
c) Vulnerability Scanners: Vulnerability scanners are the ones that find out the
vulnerabilities in the system which if accessed by a malicious user or hacker can put the
whole network system at risk.
Penetration testing is the other concept that follows the vulnerability assessment. With penetration
testing, it is possible to make use of the loopholes or vulnerabilities to gain an unauthorised
access. It validates how effectively the system can respond to the real life attacks.
OWASP (Open Web Application security Project) focuses on providingthebetter security of the
software. It has enlisted commonly critical vulnerabilities that the application may be prone to.
These vulnerabilities when exploited provide the risk of losing security and confidentiality. For
instance, Injection vulnerability occurs due to the execution of a command or query for an
untrusted data;Broken Authentication and Session Management, due to improper implementation
of an application risks the user’s confidentiality. Cross Site Scripting, commonly referred as XSS
is another flaw in which attacker injects malicious script into web pages viewed by users and also
to bypass access controls. Insecure Direct Object References, in which developers unknowingly
leave some holes which give a chance to attackers to access and manipulate directory, database
key.Cross Site Request Forgery or CSRF,is an attack where user is forged to click on a link that
is intuitively designed to steal the cookies and other private details of the user. Sensitive data
exposure is another area of vulnerability where the sensitive data such as credit card details,
authentication credentials etc. are notsecuredwhich helps an attacker to conduct the fraud [15].

Next subsections discuss various scanners and the results obtained by scanning various web
applications using these scanners.
3.1NMAP
Nmap is a port scanner that is used to scan the ports. It takes an IP address or the host name and
then finds the basic information related to it. If an IP address is provided, it then finds the host to
which it belongs to. It also finds the number of ports that are running on that particular host,
number of ports that are opened, number of closed ports, services provided by those ports, for
instance, whether services are TCP-oriented or FTP-oriented [10]. It even predicts the type of
operating systembeingused on that particular host. The topology of the scanned host is recorded
in the graphical format which shows the various gateways through which the local machine
accesses that particular remote host.
Considering the ports that are opened, an attack can be designed in order to have an unauthorised
and a legitimate access to the host with a goal set in mind. Moreover, if the opened ports are
providing the services which are TCP-oriented or FTP-oriented, it becomes easy to gainaccess to
the host.
A number of various sites have been scanned using NMAP. The figure below depicts the results
obtained after scanning RTU website.
Figure1. Nmap basic output for RTU website
Figure 1 shows the basic details of RTU website including the IP address, number of total ports
available, number of open ports discovered, performing RPCGrind scan and much more other
relevant details.

Figure2. Host details of RTU
Figure 2 outlays the host details of RTU website which includes the host status that depicts the
number of total ports scanned, number of open ports available, number of filtered ports. It shows
IPv4 address of the website ;IPv6 and MAC address are not available for this website. Further,
the type of operating system used and its accuracy of being correct is also illustrated. In this case,
types of operating system detected may be Microsoft Windows Vista Home Premium SPI,
Windows 7or Server2008. The accuracy with which this result has been obtained is 92%
approximately.
Figure3. Details of closed and open ports of RTU
118
International Journal on Computational Sciences & Applications (IJCSA) Vol.4, No.1, February 2014
Figure 3 shows the list of open ports on RTU website. It depicts the port number, protocol used
on that port, its state of being open or closed or filtered, type of service provided on that port and
the version details. For instance, port 21 is in open state where TCP protocol is used and the
service provided is FTP.
3.2 NESSUS
Nessus is a vulnerability scanner that liststhe various vulnerabilities present inthe remote host. It
provides both internal andexternal scan. Internal scan is related to hosts within a particular router.
External scan involves the hosts outside the particular router (a remote host). Web application
test is also performed in the scanner. Either the scanning can be done at the first instance provided
or a template can be created first for a particular host and then it can be launched to run the scan
against that host. Multiple scanning of the hosts can be done at once. The vulnerability found by
Nessus exists in four different types of severity-High, Medium, Low and Informal[7].
Results are also saved as soon as the scan of a particular host is completed. The results are
provided in twodifferent ways-vulnerabilities by plug-ins and vulnerabilities by host.The former
categoryfirst classifiesallthevulnerabilitiesfound during scan, andthen showsthe hostsaffected
by those vulnerabilities. Using the generated report, problems can be identified and fixed easily.
The latter category identifies all hosts found during the scan and their associated vulnerabilities.
This report addresses distinct issues associated with reliable hosts, PCI scans, follow-up scans,
and targeted assessments.PVS real-timescanning completesNessus active scanningby providing
continuous network evaluation and bridges security gaps between scans. The results can be
exported in any desired format (e.g.PDF, HTML, CSS etc).
Nessus is based on client–server architecture.Each session is controlled by the client and the test
is run on the server side.
More than 100 websites have been scanned using Nessus. The figure below depicts the results
obtained for Hebron website.
Figure4. Vulnerability details for Hebron website using Nessus
119
International Journal on Computational Sciences & Applications (IJCSA) Vol.4, No.1, February 2014
Figure 4 shows the scan results for Hebron website using Nessus scanner. It shows total 29
vulnerabilities for this particular website- 0 Critical, 1 High, 3 Medium, 2 Low and 23 Informal.
The range of either being high, medium, low or informal type is also given. For instance, FTP
privileged port bounce scan is belongs to high category ranging to 7.5 with its plugin ID given as
10081.
The report generated provides the description for all the vulnerabilities that occurred in the
scanning process with its appropriate solution. For example, the report of Hebron website states
that FTP privileged port bounce scan belonging to plugin ID 10081means that the remote FTP
server is possibly vulnerable to FTP bounce attack i.e. forcing the remote FTP server to connect
to third parties providing the intruder an opportunity to make use of their resources and
compromise the security of the website.
3.3ACUNETIX WVS
Acunetix WVS is an exploit analysis tool for performing web security audits. The criteria on
which Acunetix WVS work includes- target specification, site crawling and structure mapping
and pattern analysis.
a) Target Identification: WVS checks target(s) with activeweb server, and therefore,host
any web application. Information is collected regarding web-technologies used, web
server-type and responsiveness for appropriate filtering tests.
b) Site Crawling and Structure Mapping: The index file of web application is fetched
first, determined by the URL (e.g., http://192.168.1.128:80/ will load the main
index.html). Received responses are parsed to get links, forms, parameters, input fields,
and client side scripts that buildsa list of directories and filesinside the web application.
c) Pattern Analysisis executedagainst theweb application.
Various web applications have been scanned using Acunetix WVS. The figure shown below
depicts the result obtained after scanning Air India Website.
Figure5. Crawlingdetails for Air India website using Acunetix
120
International Journal on Computational Sciences & Applications (IJCSA) Vol.4, No.1, February 2014
Figure 5 shows the crawling structure of Air India website obtained after scanning it using
Acunetix WVS. Crawling, in general, refers to navigate all the pages of a complete web
application. It enlists all the various portions of websites that have been scanned and identifies the
vulnerabilitywhich may be present in any of those crawled pages.
Figure6. Vulnerability Alert Summary Details of Air India website using Acunetix WVS
Figure 6 shows the summary of vulnerabilities found during the scan of Air India website. It
provides the target information, types of vulnerabilities detected and the vulnerability threat level.
In this case, total 537 alerts are found-291 Medium and 246 Informal. As such, no high category
vulnerability is detected and the preferred Acunetix threat level is Level 2: Medium.
3.4NIKTO
Nikto is a command based tool that is also used to scan the specific targets. It requires havingthe
Perl language installed in the system since the functionality is based on this language. It performs
the security check against dangerous files/CGI problems on servers. Attackers look for web
server vulnerabilities to gain access of everything from insecure WordPress implementation to
outdated Apache servers.
Nikto is free and open source Web server security scanner therefore IT security teams can better
understand the server security at their enterprises and take positive steps toward shielding and
121
International Journal on Computational Sciences & Applications (IJCSA) Vol.4, No.1, February 2014
upgrading systems. The tool is able to find the scamp serversthat weren’t set up by the enterprise
and reveals vulnerabilities. It can also perform the security check against over 65,000 dangerous
files/CGI and 1,250 outdated servers[11].
3.5BURPSUITE
Burp is a proxy based tool package. It consists of various functional specifications. To start
working with Burp, it first requires setting the proxy in the browser whichever is being used as
127.0.0.1. After the proxy is set in the browser, Burp is ready to begin with.
Burp window involves many tab specifications such as Proxy, Intruder, Spider, Repeater,
Sequencerand Scanneretc. where each tab has its own sub tabs. For instance, Proxy tab has three
sub tabs-Intercept, Proxy, Options.
Proxy tab is used to set the proxy and configure it. The Intercept sub tab within it remains on at
this time. A Xampp server is installed in the system which provides the Mutillidae server that is
developed with the idea of testing the applications. Through this, you can identify the username
and password for a particular user provided that Intercept tab is off at that time when you are
trying to access it from Mutillidae.
Intruder tab is used to automate customized attacks against web applications to detect and exploit
all common vulnerabilities. Spider tab provides the crawling feature in the web application test.
Repeater tab is used to modify HTTP requests manually and analyses their responses[8].
Scanner performs the scanning of the hosts. With trial version, The Scanner feature is not
available. A full professional version needs to be purchased in order to perform the
scanning. Scanning involves testing the hosts for the vulnerabilities present in it. It
identifies the type ofvulnerability and its severity.
4. COMPARISONOFSCANNERS

The table compares the differentscanners for the different vulnerabilities. As seen from the table,
Nessus is the only scanner that has detected most of the listed vulnerabilities followed by
Acunetix WVS and Burp.
Various web applications are scanned using Nessus, Retina, Netrecon and ISS in [5] and
comparisonis madebetween them as shown in table 3.

Comparing Table 2 and Table 3, it is observed that Nessus isacommonly usedtool.Our paper in
contrast to [5], focuses on more recent tools and vulnerabilities, as the study in [5] is done in year
2006. In table2, Nessus has come out with the best scanning capabilities while intable 3,Retina
has proved itself to be good among all others. This is due to thechoice of vulnerabilities selected
for comparison.
5.CONCLUSION
Various techniques can be used to list the vulnerabilities present in the web applications or remote
host. Vulnerability assessment plays a significant role in securing the network system. Our
observations show that different scanners detect different type of vulnerabilities but a single tool
is not capable of detecting all type of vulnerabilities. This paper addressed various tools used for
scanning vulnerabilitiesand their comparative study. Weidentified what vulnerabilitiesa specific
tool is capable of detecting by running each on a number of web applications
BurpSuite has many features incorporated within it which is not available in other tools and hence
can be integrated with the other tool that works differently and produces different results.
Sometimes a tool detects the vulnerabilities that may not be detected by the other tools, so it will
prove bonus if various tools integrate with each other as the number of vulnerabilities detected
will be the total sum of all the vulnerabilities detected by each tool which will be greater than the
number found by each tool individually. Although the task is tedious but with thorough
understanding of the different criteria on which the tools work may lessen the burden of
complicacy of implementing the same. Our research focuses on the implementation of a test-bed
wheredifferent scanners will be combined on the basis of their capabilities.
